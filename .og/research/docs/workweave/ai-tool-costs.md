# AI tool costs

> AI tool costs per engineer in USD

## How it works

Tracks spending on AI coding assistants per engineer. This is a lower bound estimate—not all tools report detailed cost data.

| Tool        | Cost data     |
| ----------- | ------------- |
| Cursor      | ✓ Full        |
| Claude Code | ✓ Full        |
| Copilot     | Not available |
| Windsurf    | Not available |

## Evaluating ROI

Cross-reference with [AI code percentage](/metrics/ai-code-percentage) and [code output](/metrics/code-output) to assess whether the investment is translating to productivity gains.
