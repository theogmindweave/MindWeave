> Pull your data from the Weave API

To pull your data from the Weave API, first you need to create an API key.

1. Visit the [settings page](https://app.workweave.ai/organization/settings)
2. Click the + button to create a new API key
3. Give the key a descriptive name
4. Copy the key - you won't be able to see it again, so make sure to store it in a safe place!
5. Use the key to pull the data you want from the Weave API.
