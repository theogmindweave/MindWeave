> How to connect your self-hosted Bitbucket Data Center instance to Weave

## Setup

To set up a self-hosted Bitbucket Data Center instance, you need to create an Application Link in Bitbucket. This allows Weave to authenticate with your instance and access your repositories.

1. Log in to your Bitbucket Data Center instance as an administrator.
2. Go to **Administration > Application Links**.
3. Select **Create link**.
4. Choose **External application** and set the direction to **Incoming**.
5. Fill in the following details:
   * **Name**: Weave
   * **Redirect URL**: `https://app.workweave.ai/api/bitbucket/oauth/callback`
   * **Permissions**:
     * **Projects**: Admin
     * **Repositories**: Read and Write
6. Select **Save**.
7. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client secret**.
8. Go to the [Weave data sources page](https://app.workweave.ai/data).
9. On the Bitbucket card, click **Connect self-hosted**.
10. Enter your instance URL, Client ID, and Client secret in the form.

## Permissions

Weave requires the following permissions to function correctly:

* **Projects: Admin**: Required to fetch workspace members and list projects.
* **Repositories: Read and Write**: Required to read repository data (commits, PRs) and to set up webhooks for real-time updates.

## Unique differences

Unlike Bitbucket Cloud, which uses a centralized OAuth application registry, Bitbucket Data Center requires you to manually create an Application Link on your specific instance. This is why you must provide the Client ID and Secret generated by your instance rather than just clicking a "Connect" button.
