## Metrics enabled

Once connected, you can track:

* **Task delivery** — Issues completed over time
* **Task lead time** — Time from creation to completion
* **Cycle velocity** — Work completed per cycle
* **Bug tracking** — Bug issues and resolution time

## Linking tasks to PRs

Weave automatically links PRs to Linear issues when:

* The PR branch name contains the issue ID (e.g., `feat/ENG-123-feature`)
* The PR title or description mentions the issue ID

This enables tracking from issue creation through code delivery.
