# PR merge time

> Median time from when a PR was opened to when it was merged

## How it works

PR merge time measures the time from when a pull request is opened to when it is merged.

The metric reports the **median** value.

## Comparison with cycle time

[PR cycle time](/metrics/pr-cycle-time) starts from the first commit, while merge time starts when the PR is opened. If merge time is high but cycle time is reasonable, reviews are likely the bottleneck.
