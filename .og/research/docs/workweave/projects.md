# Projects

> Track progress on projects and debug issues causing them to slip

<Tip>
  In Weave, we call a collection of tasks a "project". In Jira, it's called an
  "Epic".
</Tip>

## How it works

For every project in your project management system, Weave takes a snapshot of the project state
every day. Then it tracks how the project changes over time, including:

* Tasks that were unplanned when the project started that were later added
* Scope changes from adding, removing, or re-estimating tasks

Wherever possible, Weave ties back **estimates** from tasks to the actual **output** associated with
them. For example, the project focus percentage pie chart is based on the percentage of **output**
for each contributor that went to the given project (as opposed to story points or something else).
