# SSO

> Configure single sign-on for your organization

Weave supports Single Sign-On (SSO) through SAML, OIDC, and OAuth providers.

## Supported providers

| Type  | Examples                 |
| ----- | ------------------------ |
| SAML  | Okta, OneLogin, Azure AD |
| OIDC  | Auth0, Google Workspace  |
| OAuth | Custom OAuth providers   |

## Setting up SSO

SSO is configured by the Weave team. Contact [support@workweave.ai](mailto:support@workweave.ai) to set up SSO for your organization.

Once configured, you'll receive:

* A sign-in URL for your organization
* Instructions for your identity provider

## How it works

1. Users navigate to your SSO sign-in URL
2. They authenticate with your identity provider
3. Weave creates or links their account automatically
4. Users are redirected to Weave

## Admin-invite links

Admins can generate SSO sign-in URLs that automatically associate new users with your organization. Share these links with team members to streamline onboarding.

## Existing users

Users who signed up with Google or GitHub before SSO was enabled can continue using those methods. They'll be linked to the same account.
