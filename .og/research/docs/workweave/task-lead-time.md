# Task lead time

> Median time from when a task starts to when it's completed

## How it works

Measures the time from when a task is marked "in progress" to completion. The clock starts when work begins, not when the ticket was created.

Reports the **median** value.

## Factors that increase lead time

* Tasks that should be broken down into smaller pieces
* Too much work in progress causing context switching
* Blockers not being surfaced or resolved
* Unclear requirements causing rework
