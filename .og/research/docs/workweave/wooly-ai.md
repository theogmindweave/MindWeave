There are several ways to open Wooly AI:

* Press `W` to toggle the Wooly AI sidebar

* Click the Wooly AI button in the bottom right corner
* Navigate directly to `/agent`

## Using mentions

You can mention specific team members or teams in your queries using `@`:

* `@John Smith` - Reference a specific person
* `@Backend Team` - Reference a specific team

Mentions work with both regular queries and slash commands.

## Memories

Wooly AI remembers important context about your organization, such as:

* Team structures and responsibilities
* Project priorities and goals
* Historical context you've shared

This helps provide more relevant and personalized responses over time.

## Charts and visualizations

When you ask about metrics, Wooly AI automatically generates charts to visualize the data. These charts are interactive and can be explored further.
