Adam B Cohen,2025-12-22,"We're seeing the first signs of AI engineering slop in our data (10,000 engineers across 500+ companies). To be clear, I think the data is still inconclusive but it's something we're going to stay very close to. The best measures of AI slop is AI code turnover: the % of AI code that is being re-written in the following three months and # of bugs created by AI written code. Both are lagging indicators. In 2025, code turnover stayed between 5.4% and 8.5% for most of the year. But then September and October spiked to 11.4% and 9.8%. This means code written in September-October has already been rewritten at a higher rate, despite being only 1-2 months old. 2025 proved teams are shipping faster with AI, but the long-term maintainability of that code is going to be the big question for 2026. …more",Image,None

Adam B Cohen,2025-09-29,"I’m starting a new position as (the first ever) Engineering Management Evangelist at Weave ! Here's what I'll do: I’ve been talking to Adam Cohen and following Weave’s journey for a while. They started with a simple goal - how can we help engineering teams become more productive? Then they quickly realized there is a critical step you have to do before that - how can you accurately measure yourself and understand where your team stands? Not just the processes (DORA metrics, such as Deployment frequency), but the actual output the team delivers. We believe that until a couple of years ago an accurate measurement was impossible - but now, with AI, the ground is ready for improvements in that area. It’s an ambitious and complex mission, but I love challenges 🙂 Oh, and back to the original question - Engineering Management Evangelist means I’ll focus on helping Engineering Managers discover and adopt Weave. A combo of Engineering + Marketing + Writing. As someone who’s used purely to engineering work, I have no idea how it will go, but I appreciate Adam taking a bet on me!

Adam B Cohen,2024-12-29,"Today we're launching the next evolution of Weave: an ML-powered tool to measure engineering output, that actually understands engineering output! Why? Here’s the thing: almost every eng leader already measures output - either openly or behind closed doors. But they rely on metrics like lines of code (correlation with effort: ~0.3), number of PRs, or story points (slightly better at ~0.35). These metrics are, frankly, terrible proxies for productivity. We’ve developed a custom model that analyzes code and its impact directly, with a far better 0.94 correlation. The result? A standardized engineering output metric that doesn’t reward vanity. Even better, you can benchmark your team’s output against peers while keeping everything private. We’re just getting started. In the future, we’ll build more metrics that go deeper into things like code quality and technical leadership, and provide actionable suggestions to help teams improve and track progress.

Andrew D Churchill,2025-12-23,"DORA metrics weren't built to measure AI impact. They track DevOps process, not code output, quality, or cost. If you're planning to use DORA to measure AI in 2026, you're flying blind! If you want to know how well your team is using AI, there are 3 things you need to measure (the AI3): 1. AI output percentage How much meaningful code is AI contributing? Not lines of code, but actual complexity. This tells you if AI is doing real work or just boilerplate. 2. Code turnover How much AI-generated code gets rewritten later? If 60% of your AI code needs fixing within weeks, you're not moving faster, you're running in place! 3. AI cost How much are you spending per unit of output? Easy to burn thousands on tokens and see minimal gains. Track only output and you'll tank quality. Track only turnover and you'll miss real gains. Track only cost and you'll optimize for cheap instead of effective. The goal is increasing AI output without increasing turnover or quadrupling costs.

Andrew D Churchill,2025-12-15,"A startup with 7 engineers asked me if they should start estimating work using story points. I told them it's a waste of time for any team with fewer than 20 engineers. Here's why: 𝗪𝗵𝗲𝗿𝗲 𝘀𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘆 𝗽𝗼𝗶𝗻𝘁𝘀 𝗰𝗮𝗺𝗲 𝗳𝗿𝗼𝗺 Story point estimates are a core part of Agile. Estimate how many points each task is worth, look at historical velocity, and plan what fits into the next sprint. This lets you communicate with stakeholders and (theoretically!) plan more predictably. When someone asks if their feature will be ready, you can say ""it's 8 points, we do 80 points per sprint, and we've allocated 75 points, so it'll be in the next sprint."" The stakeholder gets a timeline without understanding technical complexity. 𝗦𝗺𝗮𝗹𝗹 𝘁𝗲𝗮𝗺𝘀 𝗱𝗼𝗻'𝘁 𝗻𝗲𝗲𝗱 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝘀 At 7 engineers, everyone knows what everyone else is working on. When something needs to be done, someone picks it up. You don't have external stakeholders asking for specific project deadlines. The CEO tells you directly what they want. You know roughly when things will be done without checking a sprint plan. At this phase, adding lots of additional process is counterproductive. 𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗰𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗴𝗲𝘀 𝗮𝘁 𝟮𝟬+ 𝗲𝗻𝗴𝗶𝗻𝗲𝗲𝗿𝘀 At this scale, you have multiple teams, product managers fielding requests from different departments, and quarterly planning sessions where executives need to understand what's feasible. You can't coordinate informally anymore. You need a standardized way to set expectations. This is when sprint planning and story points start making sense. 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝘁𝗿𝗮𝗽 𝘁𝗼 𝗮𝘃𝗼𝗶𝗱 The biggest mistake is using story points to measure productivity. Story points are gameable and engineers struggle to accurately estimate how much each task takes. Great engineers often underestimate the amount of time and work they put into something, which makes the estimates unreliable for measurement. If you want to measure actual engineering output, it's far more accurate to use a code complexity model like Weave's. You can correlate story points to actual output to see how good your team is at estimating - but story points alone don't measure productivity! …more",Image,None
Andrew D Churchill,2025-12-08,"I talked to a VP of Engineering today who's drowning because he's trying to do two jobs at once: IC and manager. It made me wonder: how much coding (if any) should engineering managers be doing? 𝗛𝗲𝗿𝗲'𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗰𝗮𝘀𝗲 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗿𝘀 𝗰𝗼𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴: You can't make good decisions without understanding what's happening at the ground level. When you're in the code, you feel the pain of slow CI times, bad devex, and unclear abstractions. You notice when a three-month refactor isn't worth the effort. You understand when a scaling problem is hidden by bad observability. And if you're pushing your team to adopt AI tools, you need credibility. How can you tell engineers that Cursor is going to change their workflow if you've never actually used it yourself? The classic dynamic of leadership mandating AI adoption from behind a desk is exactly why so many AI initiatives fail. 𝗛𝗲𝗿𝗲'𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗰𝗮𝘀𝗲 𝗮𝗴𝗮𝗶𝗻𝘀𝘁: At a certain point, you can't keep every detail in your head. Your job is to enable your team, not to be an extra engineer on the roadmap. If you're spending significant time coding, you're probably neglecting the interpersonal work, team dynamics, and process improvements that actually matter at your level. The side project approach doesn't work either. Engineers are rightfully skeptical when you tell them you vibe coded a todo app over the weekend and therefore they should use AI for everything now. That has nothing to do with their massive, multi-tenant, complex production system. 𝗠𝘆 𝘁𝗮𝗸𝗲: If you want to be an effective leader, selectively jump down a few levels, make real contributions, and see what the world looks like.

Andrew D Churchill,2025-10-29,"I love pair programming, but most engineering teams have it backwards. They think it's too expensive and that AI can answer any question a peer could, so they avoid it. Here's why I prioritize it: 1. Speed on complex tasks If someone takes an approach that's way off base for a complex task, you review it, they fix it, and you review again. That cycle takes forever. You could have paired from the start and solved it in half the time. By the time you realize pair programming would have been faster, you've already sunk hours into the review cycle. 2. Team cohesion Pairing naturally brings people closer together. You develop a more cohesive understanding of the codebase. Every engineer has their own mental model of how the code works, like the classic story of blind men describing different parts of an elephant. Pair programming lets you fit those models together and figure out what's actually true. 3. Knowledge transfer Most of the clever keyboard shortcuts, debugging workarounds, and useful workflows I've learned came from watching someone else during pair programming! You can't get that from reading code or code reviews. 𝗛𝗼𝘄 𝘁𝗼 𝗱𝗼 𝗶𝘁 𝘄𝗲𝗹𝗹? 1. Let the less experienced person drive This sounds backwards, but the driver sets the pace. If the more experienced person drives, they'll speed through, and the other person will keep saying, ""wait, pause, go back"" (or worse, check out entirely). If the less experienced person drives, the pace naturally matches their understanding level. 2. Both people need to be engaged It's like a pilot and copilot, not a driver and passenger. The person not driving should actively check assumptions and understand what's happening. If someone is just watching without understanding, you're doing it wrong. 3. Use it for the right tasks Pair programming works great for complex problems with no clear solution. It's perfect for onboarding when you want to download information quickly. But if you're moving buttons around or doing straightforward work you already know how to do, it's probably overkill. The barriers are real; both people need to be free at the same time. Someone has to initiate; you need a big block of time, and you can't focus on your own work. So teams default to solo work plus code review. But you miss out all the benefits which are harder to quantify. --- See the impact of pair programming: www.workweave.dev …more",Image,None

Since they launched in January, Weave has been helping hundreds of the fastest-growing teams optimize their use of AI code editors, agents & reviewers. Engineering teams are throwing money at AI tools with no way to measure how effective they are or know how to improve their effectiveness. To solve this, co-founders Adam Cohen & Andrew Churchill first built ML models to answer the fundamental question: how much engineering work is actually getting done? Then they created a tool to scan every PR and show exactly how much work is completed by AI tools vs humans. Today, they’re launching tools that detect where you can improve your AI engineering and suggest what work should have been delegated to AI. And the early results they’ve seen have been incredible.

Andrew D Churchill,2025-07-29,"One year ago, I quit my job as a founding engineer with 6 months of savings and a half-baked startup idea. Today, Adam and I couldn't be more proud to share we've raised our $4.2M seed round! When we started, we didn't have a perfect vision, just the observation that AI was changing everything. Our first idea was a Slack activity summary tool, that tells you who accomplished what each week. It worked, but no one cared. Then we tried automating Canada's SRED tax credits. The unit economics were incredible until we realized we wouldn't get paid for 18 months. Not great when your only have 4 months of runway left. So we decided to go after the problem we cared about: helping engineers get better at their craft. We wanted to build the "" Gong for engineering."" It sounded compelling. We spent 3 months building and demoing, we even got 6 LOIs signed. But when we brought them our product, they all fell through. With one month of runway left and the sinking feeling that I might have to start applying for real jobs soon, we reflected on our 100s of conversations with CTOs. One statement kept coming up: ""We just need to ship faster."" When we asked them ""how do you know you are shipping faster?"" none of them had a great answer. DORA, LoC, # of PRs, gut feeling... each one had a different answer, and none of them like theirs. So we thought ""maybe we need to solve the measurement problem first?"" I spent weeks collecting data and building our first model. And then we launched on Hacker News. But our launch got flagged, and I figured that meant nothing would come of it. But then I got a notification that a $400 payment had gone through. I checked the logs and saw that a bunch of people had connected their data before the launch was taken down! We had found our first real-life paying customers, and it changed everything. This launch was the day before we had our YC interview, and with our (very recent) traction, we got in. YC turned that flicker into a fire. We launched again on LinkedIn, our calendars filled up. MRR kept growing. 2 months ago we started thinking... ""Now that we solved the measurement problem, how can we tackle the original problem of helping teams ship faster?"" So we did. With our launch today, Weave evolves from X-Ray vision, to 10X-Ray vision for engineering teams. By stacking our AI insights on top of our foundation models, we show you exactly how to ship faster with AI (and quantify it in real time). It's been a great journey to get here, and we're even more excited for what comes next! -- Notes -- To everyone who tested a broken prototype, gave us feedback, or took a bet on us early: thank you.

Andrew D Churchill,2025-07-29,"In the last 3 months I've interviewed 134 engineers, from students to CTOs (including Soham Parekh!). Here's why there's alpha in hiring junior engineers that the big companies aren't seeing. The current landscape: Teams have overcorrected away from junior talent. Engineering leaders got burned during COVID when remote mentoring failed spectacularly, and now they're gun-shy about investing in junior engineers. They can't see the long-term ROI, so it's easier to hire someone with 4+ years of experience even if their ceiling isn't as high. Meanwhile, CS programs keep churning out graduates who can't get their foot in the door anywhere, creating a massive pool of untapped talent. What big companies are missing: Junior engineers today are AI-native with no legacy patterns to unlearn, while senior engineers may be less quick to adopt. Companies are evaluating candidates with outdated criteria that don't account for AI proficiency, and using old assumptions about onboarding time when AI-savvy juniors can get up to speed much faster. The biggest blind spot is knowing where to find exceptional junior talent. A perfect example: engineers who applied to YC but didn't get in. These are often impressive people caught in what can be a coin flip selection process! How to find the right ones: Ask them about projects they've built, then drill deeper. Ask ""Why did you build this?"" and ""How does that work?"" Keep going until you hit the bottom of their knowledge. You're looking for the ones who light up talking about their projects and can explain their decisions. You'll enjoy talking to them and feel excited to have them. The ones who get defensive or can't explain past the surface are probably just chasing a tech salary. They're not worth your time. Why it makes sense for the long-run: While everyone else is zigging toward senior-heavy teams, you can zag and build a competitive advantage. Right now, you can get access to this talent while the market is messing things up. In-person work is coming back, which means you can actually mentor these junior engineers effectively. No more remote onboarding struggles that burned everyone out during COVID. The greatest teams in the next decade will be those who build strong connections in-person and leverage AI. You can find both of these in AI-native junior engineers passionate about solving a problem. Investing your time in passionate junior developers will pay off in the long run. …more",Text Only,None

I wrote an essay breaking down what makes a great candidate pitch — and why it’s different from how you pitch investors or customers. - Candidates care about their career, not your raise — your pitch should speak to what they’ll learn, build, and own. - There are three types of founder pitches: Pathos (emotional), Logos (technical), and Ethos (credibility).

Some findings were obvious: The older and bigger the company -> the slower it is (duh) With this project management tool one, I was not sure what to expect. As a burned Jira user, I know it's annoying, but I was not sure it actually has an impact on development speed. I analyzed data from 4.5k+ engineers and 200+ companies using Jira and Linear, and the data is pretty clear: Companies using Linear ship 86-91% more code than those on Jira. I know this is correlation and not causation (meaning maybe fast teams choose Linear in the first place). Still, it's quite a big difference. My hypothesis is that if people love using your product management tool, the actual state of things is updated more frequently, resulting in fewer meetings and distractions. Any other way to explain such a difference? ------ In Weave we measure productivity by 'expert hours'. Our custom models analyze each PR and give it an 'expert hours' number - how many hours would it take an expert engineer (5+ YoE, familiar with the codebase) to produce it.

Here are the requirements: - You don’t know in advance what type of company/industry you’ll operate in. - The team should be built to work YEARS together. - There will be 5 engineers on your team How will your dream team look like? Many companies and EMs choose to go with a DPS (damage per second) team. They basically try to hire the strongest engineers they can find and squeeze the most out of them. This might be the right approach for some companies (crazy growth AI startups), but I believe that for 99% of EMs, it’s the wrong approach, even assuming you have the budget for it. Such individuals are often looking for the toughest challenges, and are very hard to keep satisfied. Look at all the chaos in OpenAI/Meta talent wars.

He told the other actor he couldn't get by the chair to enter the room in the scene. The actor's response: ""Use the difficulty...if it's a comedy, fall over it, if it's a drama, pick it up and smash it."" This idea—of using the difficulty—became a defining mantra for Michael Caine's life. ""There's never anything so bad that you cannot use that difficulty...if you can use it a quarter of one percent to your advantage, you're ahead, you didn't let it get you down."" This idea hit me hard... How can you use the difficulty you're currently facing? How can you embrace the struggle? How can you find flow through the friction? How can you sow the seeds of your light during the periods of darkness? As with everything in life, control the controllable: The difficulty is already there, you can't control it. You can control how you react to it. You can control your response to it. You can control your attitude towards it. Lesson: Difficulty is inevitable.

Here’s an example: one idea I had recently was a job board for engineering managers. There are tons of job postings for EMs and engineering leads, but they all follow the same boring template: responsibilities, stack, location. You could use LLMs to reformat those into something useful - like a proper structure for EMs: What’s the team size? Is it a product-led company? What kind of engineering culture? Similarly, it can be anything that will improve your life just a bit. An internal tool for your company, an app to track your baby’s meals. Anything works (again - doesn’t have to be original!) 𝟯.

Now I can imagine that after eight hours, having a kid at home and family to take care of, you may not have the energy and time (and sanity) to spend your evenings coding. That’s why my suggestion is to start super small. Try to find 4-5 hours on a weekend, when you can do some focused work and release something - anything to get that initial dopamine boost! In the ‘job board’ example, it can be just a place where you can track your own job-searching process, suited exactly to your needs. Doing something like that is possible in a couple of hours at most, especially if you use copilots: 𝟰. 𝗨𝘀𝗲 𝗰𝗼𝗽𝗶𝗹𝗼𝘁𝘀 When I started, copilots weren’t that great yet.

Anton Zaides,2025-08-29,"The usual hip-shoot counter to deadlines is that ""fake"" deadlines lead to poor work being done, and, look: there is sometimes truth to that: --------------- From a great guest article by James Stanier , on how to use deadlines without driving your team crazy: https://lnkd.in/dYvkwyd5 --------------- Such a situation typically represents poor application, rather than issues with the methodology. Putting challenging timeboxes on projects in a healthy environment can lead to serious innovation and creativity. Doing the same with impossible timeboxes in a toxic environment will lead to all of the bad things that you expect. Deadlines really help human beings get things done. The only way that I've written books is because I set myself a challenging, but not impossible, schedule with the publisher. This contract of external accountability keeps the fire going through the long slog, and it forces me to make clear-cut decisions about what to include, what to leave out, and how to manage my spare time so I make progress. The exact same thing is true with communication and software projects. When you are asking people to do something, lead with a recommendation of when it should be done by. 𝗕𝗲 𝗲𝘅𝗽𝗹𝗶𝗰𝗶𝘁 𝗮𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝘀, 𝗯𝘂𝘁 𝗼𝗽𝗲𝗻 𝘁𝗼 𝗻𝗲𝗴𝗼𝘁𝗶𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻. It's such a simple technique, but when you compound its usage over a year at a big company, you will be amazed at the difference it makes. Deadlines force a clear tempo and cadence and, fundamentally, they make things happen. A canonical example of this is sending round a survey that can be filled in whenever versus 𝗼𝗻𝗲 𝘁𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗻𝗲𝗲𝗱𝘀 𝘁𝗼 𝗯𝗲 𝗳𝗶𝗹𝗹𝗲𝗱 𝗶𝗻 𝗯𝘆 𝘁𝗼𝗺𝗼𝗿𝗿𝗼𝘄: just by asking, you will get a much higher response rate far faster. Learn from this, and apply it to your own communication. Even though you may not think that people want it, and even if people themselves think they don't want it, knowing that things need to be done by deadlines that are just on the cusp of the comfort zone forces real, tangible progress. If you think that a prototype might take a month, why not challenge the team to see what they can deliver by the end of the week? You will be surprised, and so will they. When wielded with grace, good intentions, and knowledge of what gets humans moving and feeling good, deadlines are a powerful tool. Parkinson's Law is real, and you will need to fight it harder the larger your organization is. If you can succeed in this fight, you can grow and still ship fast with an org size of tens of thousands. If you don't, then one day you'll look around and wonder why your startup turned into the software equivalent of the local council's tax office. Fight the drag. Set a deadline. …more",Text Only,None

Here's Chaitali 's advice: Think of this as reverse-delegation. You decide for someone else, but they can take control back if they don’t like it. This approach is very useful as an upward persuasion method. The first time I used it as a new manager, I told my manager about finalizing a new hire. I said they could veto my choice if needed, but I would proceed if they didn’t respond. From then on, ""silence is consent"" became our go-to rule for many decisions. My manager was fine with me handling them. Teaching my reports this method was especially rewarding when managing a global team. My reports in India would often send me messages like “I intend to deploy this release during my day. Please leave a message if you disagree,” or “I intend to hire this senior engineer candidate. Let me know if I shouldn’t.” I could ignore most of these messages, but they also allowed me to intervene if I had strong feelings. If you are a fan of the book Turn The Ship Around, this method extends the “I Intend” approach to make decision-making easier. ----------------- In her guest article for manager.dev , she shared 4 additional persuasion methods for Engineering Managers: https://lnkd.in/dzBXb3nm …more",Text Only,None

He was right. I’ve always been too focused on the future. That’s just how my brain works - I’m a “Dreamer.” And over time, I realized that every manager (and person) has their own default: 𝟭.

Anton Zaides,2025-06-29,"During her time as an EM in Google Compute Engine, Chaitali had to make a big headcount request for a new project: ""We needed a new pre-prod environment that would allow us to test various complex scenarios for the product with efficiency and simplicity. This was a big task, the Compute stack was huge. It included different types of physical machines in a data center, networking layers, and the hypervisor. The pre-prod environment had endless use cases. Some teams wanted to test disaster recovery. Others aimed to check the UI layer’s integration. Some also wanted to test specific applications, like SAP, that our customers often used on the VMs. My approach in such cases is to use the ""Decoy Pricing Method"". Decoy Pricing is a popular marketing strategy. It encourages customers to choose a specific product. Here is an example: Suppose you go to a cafe and see that a small cup costs $2.99 and a large cup is $7.99. The price difference seems large, so you are most likely to pick the small cup. If the cafe offers a medium cup for $6.99, you might choose the large cup instead. The difference is only a dollar, so it seems like a better deal. Here, the medium cup is the decoy. When requesting the headcount, I used the decoy pricing method to build the proposal: I provided three options for different headcount increases: Small, Medium, and Large. For each request, I outlined what we would create and how the system would work in terms of Speed, Ease, and Quality. I felt a sense of joy when our leadership chose the Large option, just as Decoy Pricing predicted! This method also works when you want the decider to pick the smallest option - when asking a peer team's manager for help with our launch, I would present three options. The smallest option would be the work I truly need from them!"" -------- Loved that advice from Chatali, found it personally useful to :) In her guest article for manager.dev , she shared 4 additional persuasion methods for Engineering Managers: https://lnkd.in/dzBXb3nm …more",Text Only,None

Anton Zaides,2025-06-29,"Chaitali joined Google as an intern. In 10 years, she was promoted 5 times- to Director. Her secret? A simple Japanese approach called 𝘕𝘦𝘮𝘢𝘸𝘢𝘴𝘩𝘪: It was one of five powerful persuasion methods for engineering managers she shared in her guest article for manager.dev : https://lnkd.in/dzBXb3nm Nemawashi is a Japanese term that translates to “going around the roots.” It's a Japanese gardening technique used when transplanting trees. Transplantation (moving the tree from one location to another) is a large change for a big tree. Gently digging at its roots, one strand at a time, helps prepare the tree for the shock of the big change. As a manager, you can use the Nemawashi method when you are persuading a lot of stakeholders. The best example of this is if you want to get a higher calibration rating for your report. At Google, only a small percentage of candidates receive the “Outstanding” rating. This applies to 18% of those in organizations with 200 or more members. So only 36 people across all levels would get this rating in a director-sized organization. In one calibration cycle, I had a report who received a promotion 6 months ago. By the general rule, they would receive a “Significant Impact” rating. This is Google’s version of “Meets Expectations.” I felt they exceeded expectations even after the promotion and deserved the “Outstanding” rating. The 𝗡𝗲𝗺𝗮𝘄𝗮𝘀𝗵𝗶 method helped me convince most managers in my director's organization, including my director, of this. I met 1:1 with a few peer managers. I chose those who had experience and influence in the organization. This was before the main calibration meeting. In each 1:1, I 𝘁𝗮𝗶𝗹𝗼𝗿𝗲𝗱 𝗺𝘆 𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘀𝗼𝗻𝘀 for why my report deserved an Outstanding rating to the individual I was meeting. Some valued technical excellence, so I showed them well-written design docs. Others valued high throughput, so I showed them my report’s large number of coding contributions. Some others looked at business impact. So, I shared peer reviews from cross-functional partners, like design, PM, and GTM, who had worked with my report. With Nemawashi, I gained time to hear their honest feedback. I listened to their objections and addressed their concerns. This helped me win their support. Getting this support ahead of time made the actual calibrations much less contentious. This is how I was able to avoid the calibration blindside for my top performer and get them the Outstanding rating they deserved. ------- If you are an IC, Chatali also has a great course on Maven: ""Outstanding: Get the Ratings, Recognition & Sponsorship You Deserve"" An honest recommendation to check it out :) https://lnkd.in/dbZdThrU …more",Text Only,None

Let's take a recruiter as an example. You had a screening call with a candidate. At the end of the call, you say, ""I'll talk to my team, and we will get back to you by the end of the week"". In my experience, in 90% of the cases, they won't. It'll be the week after (best case). The candidate is not your boss, they didn't pressure you into anything. As a hiring manager, I try not to promise something like that after interviews. I say: ""Our HR team will get back to you, 2 weeks at most"" (which was our policy). Even if they plan to do it the day after. Or with customer support. I recently used a service that helped me get some tax returns. They were great, until she told me: ""I'll send your papers by Monday morning"". When they weren't sent by Tuesday, I was pissed. I called them, and she said: ""I have a lot of work, it will take me a few more days"". WHY?? It's so easy to fix that. Just underpromise! Tell me it'll take you 3 weeks. I wouldn't mind!

Nimrod , Ido and the team there are building something really interesting. Usually, Reddit is by far the biggest source for my best articles, but I wouldn't be surprised if daily.dev will surpass it this year. 2. Anyone could have written that article. It's one of my less original ones. I've heard from multiple newsletter authors: ""damn, I wish I had thought about writing it!"". It looks so easy - just Google some laws, find comics, and add a couple of sentences. The reality is that it took me 7 months to write it. I had an open draft, where I pasted interesting laws I encountered or relevant comics I saw. Only once I had 7-8, I went 'all-in' and wrapped it up. I believe this is what made it successful, as it doesn't feel like a forced aggregation. 3. For those curious, it brought ~1400 subscribers. I didn't see a huge drop in the next 3-4 emails (as happens when you get a bunch of non-relevant subscribers), so I think most of them ARE relevant.

Anton Zaides,2025-04-29,"""So, how was your weekend?"" As a manager, personal questions are tricky. Some love sharing, others shut down completely. Here's my controversial take on this: You SHOULD push for personal connection. (But not like a bull in a china shop) The standard advice? ""If they don't share, don't ask."" I disagree. Here's my approach: 1. Set expectations early - ""In our 1:1s, I like to know you as a person"" - ""Feel free to draw the line anywhere"" - ""No pressure, but connection matters to me"" 2. Read the signals - Enthusiastic sharing? Dig deeper - Short answers? Ease off - Complete deflection? Respect it 3. Match their depth - They mention kids? Ask about them - They share weekend plans? Follow up next week - They talk hobbies? Remember details 4. Lead with vulnerability - Share your own stories first - Make it optional to reciprocate - Show it's safe to open up 5. Make it relevant - Understanding motivation helps your team - Personal context improves work decisions - Strong connections build trust Your job isn't to be their friend.

Here's why junior full stack developers absolutely exist: • Modern frameworks have shortened the learning curve • They're learning in public, shipping real features • They have a holistic view from day one • They don't need to master every layer - they need to understand how they connect ""But they can't be experts in everything!"" Nobody asked them to be. Let's stop making software development harder than it is. Most features don't need deep expertise in every layer.

This reflects the actual management culture. Meta has a strong bottoms-up culture: software engineers are expected to 𝗰𝗵𝗼𝗼𝘀𝗲 what to work on. More senior engineers are expected to 𝘀𝗲𝘁 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗱𝗶𝗿𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 for their team and organization. This expectation is literally one of the four performance evaluation dimensions: “Direction,” along with Impact, Engineering Excellence, and People. As a manager, this was a mindset shift that took some getting used to. The bottoms-up culture happens in parallel, not in place of, the top-down direction. Part of the challenge of being a manager at Meta is connecting these two approaches. For example, an engineer may want to build a new feature that will increase operational costs while the top-down goal may be to increase efficiency. An interesting aspect of this is that engineers are 𝗳𝗿𝗲𝗲 𝘁𝗼 𝗽𝘂𝗿𝘀𝘂𝗲 challenging projects and set their own goals. As a manager, I had to clarify what the company expectations were and work together with them (and sometimes data-science) to align the goals with the expectations. But at the end of the day, if the engineer felt strongly enough about something, they had the freedom to pursue it. Your engineers are capable of more than you think. Trust them. Choose a small business outcome and ask them to achieve it. Give them ownership and autonomy to figure out their own path. Hold them accountable and support them. You will be surprised.

Anton Zaides,2025-01-29,"If your developer asks you for a raise, you already lost. Only 3 things can happen: 1. You don't have the budget for it. They'll be disappointed and probably leave soon. 2. You give them a raise, but less than what they asked for. They'll be disappointed. 3. You give them the raise, as you planned to do anyway. They'll feel they got what they deserve, and you get no bonus points (even if you had to fight for it). In any case of the above, you already 𝗳𝗮𝗶𝗹𝗲𝗱. There is just no way you can get out of it in a good way. Instead, 𝗬𝗢𝗨 should be the one taking the initiative. Let's flip the scenarios. 1. No raise: You tell them you really appreciate the work they do (if you really do), but there will be no raises this year due to the business situation. They might still be angry, but there is a chance they'll understand. 2. Small raise: You tell them they'll get a raise. It's less than they expected, so they might ask for an additional one, but you'll get some bonus points. 3. Good raise: You tell them they'll get the raise they expected, and they'll appreciate not needing to ask. It's actually not that hard to do. If your regular 'raises season' is in December, ask your manager to reach a decision a few weeks earlier, and initiate that conversation. …more",Text Only,None
Anton Zaides,2025-01-29,"One of your engineers tells you they signed with another company, and will leave in 30 days. What do you do? If you haven't experienced that feeling - it really hurts. You immediately start to blame yourself. ""People leave managers not jobs"", right? And being surprised feels awful. Shouldn't you have seen it coming? My answer would be to wish them good luck. Then, do a retrospective with yourself. Try to understand what you could have done differently. Then, a few days later (after calming down) - talk to them, and understand if your assumption was true, or if it was something completely different that made them leave. Yes, we should learn from our mistakes. But we can't take it personally. Your focus should be on your current employees, and on the future. …more",Text Only,None

Anton Zaides,2024-12-29,"What I wish somebody had told me during my first year as a manager: Such a crazy storm, right? Much harder than you expected. I know you feel guilty 90% of the time. - For cancelling 1:1s. - For being involved in every decision. - For firing Harry, as he was a nice guy. - For taking too long to fire Harry, as he didn’t give a shit. - For being too easy on standards, letting shitty code get into production. - For not having regular team meetings like you planned to. - For not getting along with your PM, when you know you should try harder. And that’s just a small part of your list. You feel like EVERY. SINGLE. THING. is on your shoulders. How the hell are you supposed to find the time to interview and hire, train people, perform code reviews, deal with production problems, have 1:1s, work with your PM, create a long-term vision, manage the scrum, and still find the time to lead new projects and write code! You didn’t expect the emotional drain, right? That some days you’ll be so exhausted from being responsible for everything, that you’ll come home and just collapse on the couch. Believe it or not, this is what EVERY engineering manager is going through. It gets easier in time. You get tougher, your people get better, and suddenly it’ll even feel too boring. In a year you’ll start pestering your manager for another promotion. You’re a crazy bastard. But to get there, there are 2 things you’ve got to stop doing! Yes, just 2: 1. Stop being involved in everything 2. Stop complaining about people behind their backs and doing nothing about it Do you want to know how exactly to do that?

Anton Zaides,2024-12-29,"You sent a message to one of your remote devs (during working hours), and they answered only 3 hours later. What do you do? I know most of the comments will be from angry developers, who'll say: ""What's the problem? You need to trust your team, as long as they deliver on time stop micromanaging them"". The managers in the crowd will know it's not that simple. What if another teammate is stuck and waiting for that employee? Or you want to consult them before a decision you need to make? The other extreme answer is ""I expect employees to be 100% available during their working hours, and tell me in advance if not"". This loses the biggest advantage of working from home - the flexibility. You can pick up your kids from the daycare, eat lunch with your spouse, or just take a walk to refresh your mind. Here's my answer from my Manager's ReadMe: ""Please, when you are not working for more than an hour during working hours, put ‘out of office’ in your calendar. No need to ask permission or share the reason. Same for 'focus time' - if you want to code without distractions, just put it in the calendar before you start. I’ll know not to bother you. The reason is that sometimes people depend on you, and it’s nicer for everyone to know when a response is expected."" Is this micromanagement? Probably, for some people. Still, I believe it's much better to discuss such things openly with your team, instead of being frustrated and afraid to anger them.

Anton Zaides,2024-12-29,"When the engineering manager is much more dominant than the PM, here's how it looks: I set the technical priorities, scope, and estimates. The PM filled the rest of the roadmap with their initiatives. I made the call on bug fixes and when to refactor. Sometimes I even decided on a whim to do a bigger refactor in the affected area, postponing ‘product’ work. The team provided high-level designs and estimates that were never challenged. Sounds like a dream scenario, right? A few years ago it was my reality, and I sure thought so for the first few months. The result was disappointed stakeholders and customers, which missed the whole point of engineering. It’s very tempting to focus only on our own team, fighting for time to do things ‘in the right way’. You can’t be satisfied with beautiful code and scalable systems. If your PM is not up to the task - you have to take a deep breath and just do some of the PM work yourself. Technical Debt is less scary than getting out of business. …more",Image,None

𝗔 𝗴𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘁 𝗗𝗲𝘃𝗢𝗽𝘀 team is committed to making the lives of developers better too - and it changes the whole organization. More work is done, developers are happier, and fewer people quit. The first time I felt what it's like is when we started to work with Michael Zion and MeteorOps 3 years ago (not a paid ad, a genuine appreciation). He focused on building the DevOps culture at Taranis, making sure to understand what are the needs of the developers. Today, we feel the results. The recommended ratio for DevOps/developers is 1:6, 1:10 at worst. In a 30-person R&D, we have only a SINGLE exceptional one Itai Goldman (who is currently traveling around the world - we miss you Itay!)

Anton Zaides,2024-12-29,"""There are so many software engineers who literally make ~2 code changes a month, few emails, few meetings, remote work, < 5 hours/ week, for ~$200-300k"" Deedy Das tweeted it last week. He shared the best 'tactics': • scheduled slack, email, code at late hours • private calendar with blocks • “this will take 2 weeks” (1 day) • “oh, the spec wasn’t clear” • many small refactors • “can you create a jira for that?” That drives me crazy. Honestly, I've encountered only a SINGLE developer like that, among the tens I've worked with. And those rare developers are ruining it for all of us. All managers start with the best intentions: • No micromanaging • Time management freedom • Measuring performance, not working hours But what happens when your trust is broken? When you come back from a vacation, and see that a developer didn't have any progress? And when you ask about the challenges, you get vague answers about 'rewriting the code a few times'. Our nature is to WANT to believe the other side. So you give it another chance. You set better expectations, and more structured work. And then it happens again. You feel you have no choice - you start to micromanage. Eventually, you fire that developer. But the harm is already done. Now, it's much harder to give your trust by default. And when CEOs read about such cases (Deedy even shared a list of 11 companies), everyone will suffer, not only the slackers. Amazon is not alone, the number of remote positions continues to decline.

Brennan Lupyrypa,2025-11-29,"One of the hardest parts about being a junior engineer is not knowing where you stand. Are you shipping enough? Are you working on the right things? How do you compare to more senior engineers? Having direct access to Weave 's data across 500 engineering teams, I figured I'd try to find some answers: The baseline: 3-5 PRs per week is a good target across all levels. Junior engineers average 3.4, intermediates 3.1, seniors 4.6, and staff 5.9. But the real difference between levels isn't the number of PRs. It's the complexity of what they're working on. If you only look at PR counts, you'd think staff engineers are doing 1.7x more work than juniors. But when you measure by code output and complexity, the multiplier is 3.8x. Junior engineers average 3.8 units of code output per week. Intermediate engineers are at 7.7. Seniors hit 6.9. Staff engineers reach 14.6. Staff engineers also conduct significantly more code reviews. They average 11.1 reviews per week compared to 5.1 for juniors and intermediates. And the quality of those reviews scales too, from 67 for juniors to 81 for staff. If you're a junior engineer wondering if you're on track, focus on three things: 1. Gradually increasing the complexity of problems you solve 2. Giving thoughtful code reviews 3. Writing durable code that doesn't need constant rewrites. The goal isn't shipping more PRs. It's becoming the engineer who can solve harder problems. …more",Image,None

With value-oriented entrepreneurs “dopamine attaches to the satisfaction of creating things, finding solutions, and impacting their communities for the better”…“Their work, if successful, will benefit the communities in which they live, but whose failures are experiences as disasters” Contrasting, with hedonistic entrepreneurs “dopamine attaches to the rewards that money brings, to the wielding of power, to wining out over competitors.”… ""[They] consider themselves very smart and tend to attribute failure to the fault of others, or external causes.” As I am at the beginning of my journey I am grateful to have read this book so I can continue to develop a strong support system to weather the storms that life and the pursuit of creating positive change in the world brings. …more",Text Only,None

Kevinahnn,2025-10-29,"This is a continuation from my last post. I've gotten more questions about my journey after the bootcamp and how I was able to get my first job. I spoke about how having a growth mindset gave me the confidence and the ability to learn difficult software engineering concepts. But getting my first software engineering job after a coding bootcamp was another journey. The bootcamp itself was great and I met a lot of great friends through it, but while it gave me a good foundation, it didn't prepare me for the job search. The job search, especially in software engineering, can be particularly excruciating. I learned that the hard way. To put things into perspectives, I did my applications through cold call job submissions because I was having no success in the other methods (references, connections, thoughtful messages). I decided it would be fun to track how many applications I put out there, so I can know how many I went through before I got my first job. I started applying and before I knew it I reached 100 applications. Then 200. Then 300. Then 400. Before I knew it, I ended up applying to 475 jobs before landing my first software job. From those 475 applications, only 3 responded. From those 3, I got rejected by 2 and only 1 offer. Which happened to be from Microsoft, this was one of my dream companies at the time. (Seattle native) I share all of this to say, to succeed, you need grit and perseverance. And for anyone struggling right now, just know, that for as many ""no's"" you may receive, you only need one ""yes"". I've received hundreds of no's before my big yes, and now, in hindsight, the rejections mean very little to me. So keep grinding and keep persevering and you will eventually make it! …more",Text Only,None
Kevinahnn,2025-10-29,"Several people have asked me how I transitioned to Software Engineering from Account Management/Sales, so here's the real story. Back in 2018, I began working on a coding book ( https://lnkd.in/gZ9dEeJV ) and started an online free course on how to program. It was very difficult and I felt like giving up, but I decided to stick to it. I wanted to see how far I can take it. I never had the intention of becoming a Software Engineer as I only wanted to learn how to code for fun. The concepts were foreign and hard to understand, but slowly things started to click. I kept on learning and improving to the point that I joined a bootcamp. It was a big jump, but I really enjoyed coding and really stuck with it. Towards the end of the bootcamp, I started applying to jobs and miraculously I was able to get an interview with Microsoft. A couple of interviews later, I got in. The entire time frame from when I first started learning programming to getting a job offer was just under 1 year. But what if I told you that is a lie. The truth is, I actually tried learning back in 2015, but I gave up. The same book, the same courses, but a totally different outcome. I decided that programming was too difficult and that only geniuses could learn it. My mindset was the issue. I didn't touch programming for another couple of years. BUT... in 2018, I came in, unintentionally, with a growth mindset. I decided to stick with it, keep trying to learn and break up the difficult, large and confusing concepts into smaller, more digestible ones. Then things started making sense. You should be constantly learning and working on new things and now, I look forward to these challenges instead of giving up. This is a must-have to be able to succeed. I truly recommend watching this famous TED talk from Angela Duckworth on this topic, as it helped me understand the growth mindset: https://lnkd.in/gF_Rdy-E …more",Text Only,None

Quentinkong,2025-10-29,"We finally have the proof that teams using Weave are shipping 19% more than those who don't. We analyzed 1,933,050 pull requests across 450+ companies. Our data includes hyperscalers all the way to start-ups with 3 engineers. Where does the 19% increase in velocity come from? Without proper data, teams ask the same things: ""I want to ship faster, but I don't know what's slowing us down."" ""I want to know how our shipping velocity compares to other companies."" ""I can't prove if my AI spend is paying off."" The root of these issues are the same: it's challenging to measure engineering accurately, especially now that AI is writing a ton of code. This is where Weave helps ship faster. We're able to answer the question of exactly how much work is getting done and how much is getting done by AI. We integrate directly with AI tools (Cursor, Claude, etc.) so you can see exactly who is using AI effectively and who is burning tokens. We compared teams for the 3 months before using Weave vs after using Weave and we saw a 19% velocity boost. I guess that's the power of high quality data :) You identify bottlenecks, replicate best practices from top performers, and help struggling engineers improve on a daily basis.

In partnership with leading voices like Fareed Zakaria and Niall Ferguson , organizations like The Stanford Institute for Human-Centered AI, and our investors at Lerer Hippeau , Perplexity , and f7 Ventures . Having worked on high stakes AI systems across Facebook News, Instagram Youth Safety, Meta's AI lab, and startups I support, I've seen how tricky it can be. Building AI requires thousands of complex and often subjective decisions about how to evaluate and train models. These decisions are defining the reliability and integrity of the products shaping our world: consider how chatbots, auto generated content, and future technologies will explain the news, educate children, spot safety risks, or offer mental health support. At Forum AI, we bring world-leading experts—renowned academics, seasoned journalists, and industry leaders—into the AI development process to tackle high-stakes, subjective domains like news and mental health advice that demand trusted human judgment. We've built sophisticated 'expert-in-the-loop' AI systems that efficiently scale the time and judgment of elite experts to evaluate models, with the ability to capture nuanced factors like tone, accuracy, empathy, helpfulness, and bias with precision. As we identify issues or opportunities, we work hand-in-hand with experts to craft recommendations and produce gap-filling data. If you're building AI systems and want world-class expertise in the loop, or if you're a researcher looking for your next role, we’d love to connect.

And yet, it can be a real driver of evolution for your team 🔥 This is the challenge of identifying the cause of the conflict. Because to resolve it, you must first understand it. Why this difference of opinions ? What is the root of the problem ? What are the needs and expectations of the different parties ? These are essential questions that you must ask yourself. Because behind every conflict, there is often an opportunity for improvement, untapped potential 💡 Analyzing the conflict is therefore an effective way to identify these points of improvement, optimize your processes, and strengthen the cohesion of your team. So transform your conflict into an opportunity to progress, strengthen your team, and reach new heights 🚀 Because let's not forget, conflict is not an end in itself, but a means to improve, create, and grow together. And that is the power of benevolent management 🌱 So don't be afraid of conflict, learn to manage it, analyze it, and learn from it.
