# Estimates vs. outputs

> Create a feedback loop for your estimates by comparing them with the actual code output required

## How it works

Weave pulls in your task estimates from your project management tool (e.g. Linear, Jira, etc.). It
also notes which PRs are linked to each task. By comparing the total output across all linked PRs to
the original estimate, we can see how the estimates compare with reality.

## How to use the chart

Each dot is a single task. Click on a dot to see the PRs that were linked to it.

Each color is a single assignee. Hover over an assignee in the chart legend to see their tasks highlighted.
