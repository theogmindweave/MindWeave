# Output waiting for review

> Code output of PRs awaiting first review

## How it works

Measures the total [code output](/metrics/code-output) of PRs currently waiting for their first review.

<Note>
  Once a PR receives its first review, it is no longer counted. This is a
  snapshot of the current backlog.
