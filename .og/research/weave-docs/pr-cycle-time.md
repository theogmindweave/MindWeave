# PR cycle time

> Median time from first commit to merge

## How it works

PR cycle time measures the time from when the first commit on a PR is created to when the PR is merged. This represents the full lifecycle of a code change.

The metric reports the **median** value.

## Common causes of long cycle times

* PRs that are too large in scope
* Bottlenecks in the review process
* Context switching preventing completion
* Unclear requirements leading to revisions
