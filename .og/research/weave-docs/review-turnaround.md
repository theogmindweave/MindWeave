# Review turnaround

> The time between a review request and submission

## How it works

When someone requests a review from a reviewer, the timer starts. Once the reviewer submits their
review, the timer stops. The resulting time is the review turnaround time.

## Configuration

While using review requests is the most accurate option, some teams don't use review requests at
all. In that case, you can configure review turnaround to be tracked from when the code was most
recently updated instead. Reach out to us in the in-app live chat or at [support@workweave.ai](mailto:support@workweave.ai) to set
this up for your account.

<Note>Self-reviews (where the PR author reviews their own PR) are excluded from this metric.</Note>
