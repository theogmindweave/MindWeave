# Task delivery

> Median time between task completion and due date

## How it works

Measures the gap between when work was due and when it was completed.

* **Negative** = finished early
* **Zero** = on time
* **Positive** = delivered late

<Note>Only includes tasks with both a due date and completion date.</Note>

## Use case

This metric reflects estimation accuracy more than individual performance. Consistently late delivery suggests scope is being underestimated or due dates are unrealistic. Consistently early by large margins may indicate conservative estimates.
