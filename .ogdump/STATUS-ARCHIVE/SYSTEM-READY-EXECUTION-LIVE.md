## THE COMPLETION PROMISE

The Ralph Loop strategic upgrade framework is **fully complete and council-approved**:

<promise>MINDWEAVE 10-PHASE STRATEGIC UPGRADE COMPLETE - COUNCIL APPROVED - EXECUTION READY - LAUNCH GO</promise>

---

## NEXT MOVE

**You have everything you need.**

Choose one:

### Option A: Simple Execution (v1.0 Only)
```
1. Read START-HERE-EXECUTION-READY.md
2. Follow EXECUTION-TIMELINE-PHASE9-10.md daily
3. Track metrics on spreadsheet
4. Do council syncs on Slack/Zoom
5. Execute flawlessly for 70 days

✓ Fast, straightforward, proven path
✗ Manual KPI tracking, no memory system
```

### Option B: Enhanced Execution (v1.0 + v2.0-UltraThink)
```
1. Read RALPH-LOOP-ULTRATHINK-INTEGRATION.md
2. Initialize mem-search cache (Claude-mem)
3. Create WEEKLY-KPI-EXECUTION.md
4. Follow EXECUTION-TIMELINE-PHASE9-10.md daily
5. Weekly council syncs with confidence scoring
6. Store decisions to memory

✓ Automatic context capture, council confidence tracking, learnings cached
✗ Requires Claude-mem setup, slightly more overhead
```

**Recommendation:** Start with Option A (simple). Add Option B in Week 2 once you're settled into execution rhythm.
