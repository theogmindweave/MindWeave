## 1. THE CORE FRAMEWORK: APIR

**A**dapt → **P**rune → **I**mprove → **R**epeat
*(Decoded from: "evolve → adapt → prune → repeat")*

| Phase | What Happens | Frequency |
|-------|--------------|-----------|
| **Evolve/Adapt** | System learns from developer behavior, PRs, code patterns | Continuous |
| **Prune** | Remove ineffective skills, surface what works | Weekly analysis |
| **Improve** | Refine skills based on acceptance rates, time savings | Iterative |
| **Repeat** | Continuous learning loop | Perpetual |

## 2. THE VISION (Raw Capture)

### Target Market
- **Enterprise teams**: 500+ employees
- **Initial Focus**: Engineering teams ONLY
- **Future Expansion**: DevOps, other teams
- **Tool Focus**: Claude Code first, then Cursor

### The Core Loop
