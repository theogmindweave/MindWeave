## SECTION 6: HANDLING INVESTOR OBJECTIONS

### "LangSmith is also in this space. How are you different?"
> LangSmith is observability (what happened). We're governance (what happens). Different jobs. LangSmith = rearview mirror. MindWeave = dashboard with AI and guardrails. Compliance officer needs the dashboard.

### "Couldn't Anthropic build this themselves?"
> Anthropic focuses on models, we focus on governance. Like Apple—they didn't build every app. Advantages: (1) deep vertical expertise in healthcare/finserv, (2) multi-model approach (Claude + GPT + Gemini), (3) go-to-market for regulated industries. Anthropic benefits having us as partner.

### "Your churn is high at 20%. How do you fix it?"
> Churn driven by M&A (company acquisition cuts platform), not product dissatisfaction. NPS 47 and 30% expansion prove strong PMF. We track cohort churn (right metric), not absolute. Early cohorts show <15% annual churn.

### "Compliance is boring. How do you attract talent?"
> It's exciting. Not about "compliance software"—about operating system for safe AI. Top engineers want to solve critical problem. Hired from Anthropic, Okta, LangSmith because mission resonates.

### "Why believe you'll 10x this?"
> (1) Market only beginning (0.3% penetration), (2) Unit economics exceptional (50:1 LTV:CAC), (3) Founder-product fit (I've built mission-critical systems). Most important: proven PMF already. Now capital + execution.

### Standard Term Sheet Breakdown

| Term | Typical | What It Means |
|------|---------|--------------|
| Valuation | $20M-$50M | Company worth |

| Preferred Stock | Series A | Liquidation priority |
| Liquidation Pref | 1x non-participating | They get money first |
