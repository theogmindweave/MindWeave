## Decision-Making Framework (7 Questions)

**Use this checklist BEFORE making any significant decision:**

### Q1: Is this decision required NOW or can it wait?
- **If "wait":** Defer (preserve decision energy for urgent items)
- **If "now":** Proceed to Q2

**Rule:** Batch non-urgent decisions to Friday afternoon

---

### Q2: Do I have 80% of information needed?
- **If <80%:** Gather more data (24-48 hours max, then decide anyway)
- **If 80%+:** Proceed to Q3

**Rule:** Perfect information never exists; "good enough" is fine at 80%

---

### Q3: What's the cost of being wrong?
- **If low (<$10K, easily reversible):** Decide fast
- **If high (>$100K, major impact):** Proceed to Q4

---

### Q4: Is this reversible or irreversible?
- **If reversible:** Decide fast (change course later if needed)
- **If irreversible:** Proceed to Q5

**Examples:**
- Reversible: Hiring decision (can let person go), pricing change (can revert)
- Irreversible: Burning bridge with Anthropic, publishing defamatory tweet, giving away IP

---

### Q5: Who else needs input?
- **1 person:** 30-min discussion (CTO, VP Sales, etc.)
- **2-3 people:** 60-min discussion (leadership team)
- **4+ people:** Skip consensus, founder decides (and communicates rationale)

**Rule:** Consensus decisions slow you down; founder has final say

---

### Q6: Does this move us toward Month 6-7 goal? ($500K+ MRR)
- **YES:** Prioritize (do immediately)
- **NO:** Question if worth doing
- **UNCLEAR:** Discuss with 1-2 trusted advisors

**Rule:** Everything should connect to 6-month revenue target

---

### Q7: What's the decision deadline?
- **<24 hours:** Decide now
- **24-48 hours:** Sleep on it (subconscious processing)
- **>48 hours:** Deliberate thoughtfully, gather more data

**Rule:** If deadline is >1 week away, you have time to gather more data

---

# PART 2: SALES CONVERSION ENGINE

## Discovery Call Script (20-30 minutes)

### OPENING (2 min)
```
Thanks for taking the time. Before we dive in, I want to make sure this is
worth your time. We work with companies managing Claude deployments at scale.

Are you actively exploring AI governance solutions right now? Or is this
more exploratory?

[Listen to their answer - determines how aggressive you are in sales process]
```

---

### PAIN EXCAVATION (10 min)
**Goal:** Find their real problem (not what they say, but what they actually feel)

#### Question 1: Current State
```
Walk me through how you're currently managing Claude usage across your organization.
- How many teams are using Claude?
- Who's responsible for oversight?
- How do you track spending?
```

**Listen for:** Confusion, lack of visibility, patchwork solutions

#### Question 2: The Hidden Pain
```
When you think about that process, what's most frustrating about it?
```

**Listen for:** Emotion (annoyance, anxiety, fear)

#### Question 3: Impact Magnitude
```
How much do you estimate you're wasting through:
- Suboptimal model usage (Opus when Sonnet would work)?
- Duplicate work (teams building same MCPs)?
- Uncontrolled spend?
```

**Listen for:** Numbers (bigger = more pain, more willingness to pay)

#### Question 4: Timeline/Urgency
```
When do you need to solve this? Is this:
- This month (urgent, high willingness to pay)
- This quarter (moderate urgency)
- Sometime next year (low urgency, might not close)
```

**Listen for:** Deadline signals, regulatory pressure, internal initiatives

---

### SOLUTION POSITIONING (5 min)
**Only after you understand their pain. Never pitch first.**

#### Template Based on Their Pain
```
Based on what you shared, here's what we typically see:

[Their Problem]: They have multiple teams using Claude with no visibility
[Our Solution]: MindWeave gives you dashboard visibility in 30 minutes
[Proof Point]: Company X deployed with us in 2 weeks and found $150K in duplicate work
[Outcome]: They reduced their AI spend by 40% while maintaining feature delivery
```

**Customize Every Time:** Use their company name, their specific problem, similar company case study

---

### VALUE QUANTIFICATION (3 min)
**Show them the math:**

```
Let me show you the typical ROI we see:

Your current Claude spend appears to be [estimate based on team size]:
- If you're 100 engineers: ~$50K/month
- Of that, typically 30% is waste (suboptimal models, duplicate work)
- That's $15K/month = $180K/year in unnecessary spend

Our Pro tier is $2,000/month = $24K/year

First month, you're usually ROI-positive.

Does that math feel right for your situation?
```

---

### NEXT STEP (1-2 min)
**Always propose something specific:**

```
Here's what I'd suggest:

Option 1: 14-day free trial (no credit card, no commitment)
Option 2: 30-minute security review call with our security team (if that's a blocker)
Option 3: Both - start trial while we do security review

Which would make most sense for you?
```

**Rule:** Don't leave call without commitment (even if it's "I'll schedule a trial for next week")

---

## Objection Handling (10 Exact Scripts)

### OBJECTION 1: "We can build this ourselves"

**Your Response:**
```
I understand. Many teams consider that initially. What's your team's
capacity for internal tools?

Here's what we typically see: Internal builds take 6+ months and cost
$200-300K in dev time. With MindWeave, you're live in 30 minutes.

The real question is opportunity cost. Your team could ship 3-4 product
features instead of spending 6 months on governance tooling.

Most teams who start with "we'll build it" come back to us within 12 months
because the project gets deprioritized.

Would a 14-day trial let you compare our solution to your planned build?
```

---

### OBJECTION 2: "We're too early for governance"

**Your Response:**
```
Governance can sound heavy. Here's a reframe: When do you expect your AI
usage to grow?

Early visibility prevents later problems. Teams that wait have 3x the
cleanup cost later.

Start with Team tier ($500/month) while you're growing. The foundation matters
more than timing.

By the time you need governance, you've already built the habits.
```

---

### OBJECTION 3: "Price is too high"

**Your Response:**
```
Budget matters, let's understand the value. What's your current Claude spend?

[They say a number, e.g., $30K/month]

Average customer saves 35% on token costs through optimization. At $30K/month,
that's $10.5K/month savings = $126K/year.

MindWeave is $2K/month = $24K/year.

So you're looking at $102K/year net benefit.

Let me show you the exact ROI calculator based on your numbers...
```

---

### OBJECTION 4: "We use OpenAI, not Claude"

**Your Response:**
```
Many teams use multiple models. Are you exploring Claude at all?

Multi-model is the future. We have OpenAI on our roadmap for later this year.

Let's stay in touch as your stack evolves. When you do explore Claude,
we'll be positioned to help.

[Subtle upsell: Position as "when you expand to Claude" not "if"]
```

---

### OBJECTION 5: "Security review will take months"

**Your Response:**
```
Enterprise security is thorough. I appreciate that. We can accelerate it:

- SOC 2 Type II certified (already exists)
- Pre-filled security questionnaire ready
- Dedicated security contact for fast responses

Most customers move from 6-month reviews to 4-week reviews with our materials.

Let's get security docs shared today. You can start POC while review is
happening in parallel.
```

---

### OBJECTION 6: "This isn't a priority right now"

**Your Response:**
```
Understood. You're not in urgent pain yet. Here's what's coming in 18 months:

- EU AI Act enforcement (August 2026) - regulatory requirement
- Customers demanding governance proof (for their compliance)
- Compliance auditors asking questions (first audits with AI questions)

Now is the best time to implement before urgency hits.

Want to check back in 90 days? Or better - let's do a 2-week POC now
so you're ahead of the curve.
```

---

### OBJECTION 7: "Anthropic might build this"

**Your Response:**
```
That's a fair question. Let me give perspective:

Anthropic is focused on LLM research and model building. Governance is
an operational tool - very different focus area.

We're positioned as Anthropic's governance partner, not competitor. Many customers
will use both.

If Anthropic enters the space, we integrate with them. You're not locked in
- we're your governance partner regardless of their roadmap.

Strategic bet: Anthropic validates the category, which helps us too.
```

---

### OBJECTION 8: "Competitor does what you do at lower price"

**Your Response:**
```
I hear that. [Competitor name] is good at [their primary focus]. But there's
a difference between what they do and what we do:

- [Competitor] shows what happened (measurement)
- We control what can happen (governance + compliance)

Specific capabilities [competitor] doesn't have:
- Team-based access control
- Compliance audit logs
- Approval workflows
- MCP management
- Role-based permissions

If you just want dashboards, [competitor] is fine. If you need governance
+ compliance, you need us.

Try both in your POC. You'll see the difference in 30 days. Which seems worth
exploring?
```

---

### OBJECTION 9: "Want to see multiple references"

**Your Response:**
```
Smart. You want proof from similar companies. I can connect you with:

- Large SaaS company (similar to you) - closed in 6 weeks
- Financial services company - compliance-heavy like you might be
- Mid-market startup - scaled usage like your trajectory

What specific use case do you want to talk to someone about?

I can set up a reference call this week. Which would be most valuable?
```

---

### OBJECTION 10: "Need to talk to my team/boss"

**Your Response:**
```
Of course. This is a team decision. Who would need to be involved?

[Get list: typically CTO, CFO, Compliance Officer]

Smart. Here's what I'll do:

I'll send you a 1-pager to share with them - it's quick, shows ROI clearly.

Then we can either:
- You review with team and call me back (3-5 days)
- OR I do a quick 30-minute group call with your team this week

Which would work better for you?
```

### Email Body

```
Hi [First Name],

I've been tracking your AI deployment - saw your blog post about scaling
Claude across 200+ engineers. That's impressive.

One thing I wonder: how are you managing governance as it scales?

Most teams we talk to have the same challenge:
- 40% of spend is waste (suboptimal models, duplicate work)
- No visibility into who's using what
- Compliance auditors asking questions

We built MindWeave specifically for that.

At [Similar Company], they discovered $150K in duplicate MCP work using
our Hivemind detection. Fixed in 2 weeks.

Quick 15-min call to see if it's relevant?

**Day 3:** Follow-up (if no response)
```
Hi [First Name],

Checking if you saw my note about AI governance?

If this isn't relevant for you right now, totally understand.

If it is and you're just busy, I'll follow up once more next week.

—
[Your Name]
```

**Day 7:** Value-add follow-up
```
Hi [First Name],

Saw that [Company Name] just announced [specific AI initiative].

Governance becomes critical at scale. Thought you'd find this case study
relevant: [Company X cut 40% from AI spend in first month]

Worth a quick conversation?

—
[Your Name]
```

**Day 14:** Break-up follow-up
```
Hi [First Name],

Haven't heard back, so I'm assuming this isn't the right timing.

Should I close your file and try again in 6 months? Or is there still interest?

—
[Your Name]
```

**Day 30:** Re-engagement (new angle)
```
Hi [First Name],

New case study from [similar company in their vertical]. Thought you'd find
interesting given your scale.

Worth revisiting?

—
[Your Name]
```

**Conversion Target:** 1-2% reply rate on cold outreach is healthy (1 in 50-100)

## Demo Script (30 Minutes, Minute-by-Minute)

### OPENING (0-3 min)

```
Thanks for taking the time. Just to confirm - are [Name] and [Name]
here as well? Great.

From our earlier conversation, I understand your biggest challenge is [specific
pain they mentioned]. By the end of this 30 minutes, I'm going to show you
exactly how MindWeave solves that.

Does that sound good?

[Wait for agreement before proceeding]
```

---

### ACT 1: DASHBOARD (3-8 min) - THE HOOK

```
Let me start with the dashboard. I'm going to log in with SSO [do it].

The first thing you see is your cost overview. In 30 seconds, you can see:
- Total spend this month: $250K
- Cost trend: Up 15% vs last month
- Top expensive models: Opus consuming 40% of budget

In most companies, this takes 2+ weeks to assemble manually.

[Pause for reaction. Wait 5 seconds.]

What would be valuable to see here that you're not seeing today?
```

**Key Principle:** Show value before showing features

---

### ACT 2: TOKEN ANALYTICS (8-13 min) - THE VALUE

```
Now let's dig deeper. I'm going to show you cost attribution by team.

[Click into Team view]

Here's Team A: $80K/month spend
Here's Team B: $55K/month spend
Here's Team C: $25K/month spend

But here's where it gets interesting. Team A is using Claude Opus 80% of
the time, when 90% of their work could be done with Sonnet at 20% the cost.

By switching Team A to Sonnet, you'd save $48K/month. That's $576K/year.

That's where customers find 30-40% savings.

[Pause. Let the number sink in.]

Does that match what you're seeing in your costs?
```

**Key Principle:** Connect feature to their specific benefit (quantified)

---

### ACT 3: MCP REGISTRY (13-18 min) - THE DIFFERENTIATION

```
Now let me show you the MCP Registry - this is where you get complete
visibility into your AI tool stack.

[Pull up registry]

You can see all 47 MCPs deployed across your teams:
- 30 are approved and in production
- 12 are in testing
- 5 are pending security review

Notice something? We've highlighted these 3 MCPs as duplicates. They all
do the same thing: "Query Customer Database." They're just implemented
by 3 different teams.

That's $150K/year in wasted engineering time on duplicate work.

[Pause. Let them think about their situation.]

How many duplicate efforts like this do you think exist in your org?
```

**Key Principle:** Show unique capability (Hivemind) that competitors don't have

---

### ACT 4: COMPLIANCE (18-23 min) - THE ENTERPRISE SEAL

```
Last thing - compliance. This is where the enterprise value really shows up.

[Pull up audit logs]

Every action is logged: Who accessed what MCP, when, and why. This is
exportable for your auditors.

You have role-based access control - you can assign different permissions
to different teams. Finance sees cost data, Engineering sees tool registry,
Security sees audit logs.

For SOC 2 compliance, we have pre-filled security questionnaires ready.
Most customers go from 6-month audit prep to 4-week prep.

[Pause.]

When's your next compliance audit?
```

**Key Principle:** Close on their stated pain point (compliance)

---

### CLOSE (23-30 min) - THE DECISION

```
Let me recap what I've shown you:

1. Cost visibility - $250K spend visible in 30 seconds (saves 2+ weeks)
2. Cost optimization - $48K/month savings per team ($576K/year)
3. MCP governance - Duplicate detection, consolidation ($150K/year savings)
4. Compliance readiness - Audit logs, access control (4-week vs 6-month audit)

That's roughly $726K/year in value we've identified.

The investment is Pro tier at $2,000/month = $24K/year.

That's 30x ROI.

Now, here's what I'd suggest:

Option 1: 14-day free trial - no credit card, test with your team
Option 2: 30-minute security review call (if that's a blocker)
Option 3: Both - start trial while we do security review

Which makes most sense for you?

[Stop talking. Wait for them to respond. Don't fill silence.]
```

**Key Principle:** Recap quantified value, show ROI math, propose specific next step

---

## Pricing Scripts

### Annual Discount Script
```
If we close by Friday, I can offer 15% off annual prepay.

That brings your first year from $24K to $20.4K.

You're essentially getting 1.8 months free. Does that make sense?
```

### Trial Extension
```
Let's extend for 1 more week to address [specific issue].

By then you'll have complete clarity on [specific metric they care about].

Does that help?
```

### Pilot Scope Reduction
```
I hear you. Let's start with one team and prove value before full rollout.

Team size: 20-30 people = $500/month
Timeline: 30 days of testing
Success metric: 25% cost reduction identified

After 30 days, you'll have proof to justify wider rollout.

Sound good?
```

### ROI Justification
```
Your spend is $30K/month.

Typical optimization: 35% = $10.5K/month savings
Our cost: $2K/month
Net benefit: $8.5K/month = $102K/year

First month, you're ROI-positive.

Does that change how you think about the investment?
```

## Feature Prioritization Decision Matrix

**Use this matrix for every feature decision:**

For each proposed feature, score 0-10 on:

1. **Competitive Win Rate** (0-10)
   - 10 = Closes deals vs competitors
   - 0 = Nice to have, doesn't impact sales

2. **Customer Activation** (0-10)
   - 10 = Customers immediately use after launch
   - 0 = Low engagement, sits unused

3. **Technical Complexity** (1-10, inverted)
   - 1 = Quick win (1-2 eng-weeks)
   - 10 = Major undertaking (6+ eng-weeks)

4. **Revenue Multiplier Effect** (0.5-3.0x)
   - 1.0x = Table stakes (required, not differentiating)
   - 2.0x+ = Expansion trigger (enables upsell)
   - 3.0x+ = Category creator (only us can do this)

**Scoring Formula:**
```
Feature Score = (CompWinRate × 0.4) + (Activation × 0.25) + (TechComplexity × 0.15) + (RevenueMultiplier × 0.2)

Example: Cost Dashboard
= (90 × 0.4) + (95 × 0.25) + (2 × 0.15) + (1.0 × 0.2)
= 36 + 23.75 + 0.3 + 0.2
= 60.25 (HIGH PRIORITY)

Example: Slack Integration
= (50 × 0.4) + (40 × 0.25) + (2 × 0.15) + (0.8 × 0.2)
= 20 + 10 + 0.3 + 0.16
= 30.46 (LOWER PRIORITY)
```

**Decision Rule:** Launch features scoring 50+ in priority order

## Operating Expense Projections

### Engineering (50% of budget)
- **Months 1-3:** Founder + 1 contractor ($80K/month)
- **Months 4-6:** + 1 FT engineer ($130K salary) + 1 contractor = $130K/month
- **Months 7-12:** + 2 more engineers, remove contractor = $280K/month
- **Months 13-24:** + team lead, QA engineer = $400K/month

### Sales & Marketing (30% of budget)
- **Months 1-3:** Founder sales only ($0 additional)
- **Months 4-6:** + $5K/month in marketing = $5K/month
- **Months 7-9:** + 1 AE ($160K OTE) = $45K/month
- **Months 10-12:** + 1 SDR + content marketer = $75K/month
- **Months 13-24:** + 1 more AE, demand gen, sales ops = $150K/month

## Cash Runway & Series A Timing

### Funding Requirements
- **Initial raise (Seed):** $500K - $1M
  - 18 months of runway at $80-100K/month average
  - Founder should target Month 6 closure

### Break-Even Analysis
- **Path to profitability:** Month 18-22
- **Path if Series A closes Month 9:** Extend runway to Month 36+
- **If no Series A:** Can bootstrap to profitability with slower hiring

### Series A Triggers
By Month 9, you should have:
- [ ] $100K+ MRR
- [ ] 50-75 customers (primarily enterprise)
- [ ] 20%+ MoM growth for 3+ months
- [ ] 115%+ NRR
- [ ] 3-5 design partner case studies
- [ ] Anthropic partnership relationship established
- [ ] $5-10M ARR projection for Year 2

---

## 5 Stress-Test Scenarios & Mitigation Plans

### Scenario 1: Customer Acquisition Rate Drops 50% (5 customers/month → 2.5)

**Impact:**
- Month 12 MRR: $58K (vs $116K target)
- Year 1 ARR: $700K (vs $1.4M target)
- Runway: Extended 6 months but Series A at risk

**Mitigation Plan:**
1. Increase founder sales involvement (close 1-2 deals/month yourself)
2. Launch Anthropic partnership channel (tap their enterprise customers)
3. Implement low-touch product-led growth (freemium tier)
4. Adjust sales targets: Accept slower growth vs burning out team

**Decision Trigger:** If 2 consecutive months <5 customers, activate plan

---

### Scenario 2: Churn Increases to 2% (vs 0.5% target)

**Impact:**
- Year 1 retention: 82% (vs 94% target)
- NRR: 100% (vs 115% target)
- Year 2 requires 50% more new customer acquisition to offset churn
- Signals: Product-market fit issue or pricing resistance

**Mitigation Plan:**
1. Pause new customer acquisition for 2-4 weeks
2. Emergency customer success intervention (founder calls at-risk accounts)
3. Product quality audit (is core product stable?)
4. Pricing review (are we overpriced vs LangSmith, Weave?)
5. Diagnosis: Why are customers leaving? (product, price, alternatives?)

**Decision Trigger:** If monthly churn >1.5% for 2 consecutive months

---

### Scenario 3: Gross Margins Decline to 60% (vs 75% target)

**Impact:**
- Unit economics deteriorate
- CAC payback period extends (lower profitability)
- Series A becomes harder to close (investors want 70%+ gross margins)

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- Increased infrastructure costs?
- Excessive support burden?
- Price competition forcing lower pricing?
- Enterprise customers demanding customization?

**Mitigation Plan:**
1. Audit all cost drivers (hosting, bandwidth, support staff)
2. Implement support efficiency (chatbots, better docs, self-service)
3. Raise prices on new customers (grandfather existing)
4. Reduce customization scope (SOPs, strict contract terms)

**Decision Trigger:** If margins <65%, immediate action needed

---

### Scenario 4: Cannot Raise Series A by Month 9

**Impact:**
- Forced to bootstrap or extend runway with smaller seed extension
- Slower hiring = slower product development
- Competitive risk: Weave, Anthropic may move faster

**Mitigation Plan A: Bootstrap to Profitability**
- Cut burn rate by 30% (delay hiring, tighter cost control)
- Push for profitability at $150K MRR (Month 15-18 instead of never)
- Focus on highest-margin segments (enterprise)
- Extend runway from 12 months to 24 months

**Mitigation Plan B: Take Bridge Financing**
- Ask existing investors for $250-500K bridge
- Use to extend runway 6-9 months
- Hit revenue milestones that make Series A easier

**Mitigation Plan C: Strategic Partnership**
- Approach Anthropic for investment (strategic round)
- AWS for co-sell partnership + investment
- Larger competitor for acquisition (exit)

**Decision Trigger:** By Month 6, if no Series A momentum, activate Plan B

---

### Scenario 5: Anthropic Launches Competing Governance Product

**Impact:**
- Potential market compression
- Sales resistance ("why buy third-party when Anthropic offers it?")
- Acquisition conversations with Anthropic may accelerate

**Mitigation Plan:**
1. **Immediate (Week 1):** Assess competitive feature parity
2. **Week 2-4:** Differentiate on multi-model support (OpenAI, Gemini, etc.)
3. **Month 2:** Accelerate enterprise compliance features (FedRAMP, HIPAA)
4. **Month 3:** Explore acquisition conversations with Anthropic
5. **Alternative:** Position as "enterprise layer on top of Anthropic governance"

**Valuation Scenarios:**
- If Anthropic product is weak: No impact, continue building
- If Anthropic product is strong: Acquisition at $200-300M likely
- If Anthropic wants strategic moat: Could offer $500M-1B (control market)

**Decision Trigger:** Product announcement from Anthropic = activate response plan same day

## NRR Mathematics (How to Hit 115%+)

### The Math Behind 115% NRR

```
Starting Cohort (Month 0): 100 customers at $500/mo Team tier = $50K MRR

MONTH 12 PROJECTION (Conservative 85% retention + 25% expansion):

65 customers stay at Team: $32.5K MRR
  - Loss: 15 customers (churn)
  - No expansion for these

20 customers upgrade Team → Pro: $40K MRR
  - ACV increase: $500 → $2K = +$1.5K per customer
  - Total: 20 × $1.5K expansion = +$30K

5 customers upgrade Pro → Enterprise: $25K MRR
  - ACV increase: $2K → $5K = +$3K per customer
  - Total: 5 × $3K expansion = +$15K

3 customers upgrade Team → Enterprise (direct): $15K MRR
  - ACV increase: $500 → $5K = +$4.5K per customer
  - Total: 3 × $4.5K expansion = +$13.5K

MONTH 12 TOTAL MRR: $32.5K + $40K + $25K + $15K = $112.5K

NRR CALCULATION:
= (Expansion MRR + Retained Base MRR) / Original Base MRR
= $112.5K / $50K = 2.25 = 225% 🚀

Wait, that's too high! Let me recalculate with more realistic churn...

REVISED (20% churn instead of 15%):
- 80 customers retained (20% churn)
- 60 stay at Team: $30K
- 15 upgrade Team → Pro: $30K
- 5 upgrade to Enterprise: $25K

Month 12 MRR: $85K
NRR = $85K / $50K = 170%

EVEN MORE CONSERVATIVE (25% churn, 20% expansion):
- 75 customers retained
- 60 stay at Team: $30K
- 12 upgrade Team → Pro: $24K
- 3 upgrade to Enterprise: $15K

Month 12 MRR: $69K
NRR = $69K / $50K = 138%

KEY INSIGHT: Even with 25% annual churn, you can hit 115%+ NRR
with just 20% of retained customers upgrading to higher tiers.
```

---

### Expansion Revenue Model (Per Customer Cohort)

**Assumption:** Each cohort has different upgrade timing

```
COHORT 1 (Month 1): 3 customers at $500/mo
↓ Month 5 (4 months later): 1 upgrades to Pro (+$1.5K/mo expansion)
↓ Month 8: 1 more upgrades to Pro (+$1.5K/mo expansion)
↓ Month 12: 1 upgrades to Enterprise (+$4.5K/mo expansion)

Cohort 1 Month 12 Revenue:
- 3 base customers × $500 = $1.5K
- 2 Pro customers × $2K = $4K
- 1 Enterprise customer × $5K = $5K
- Total: $10.5K (vs starting $1.5K)
- Expansion multiple: 7x

COHORT 6 (Month 6): 5 customers at $500/mo
↓ Month 10: 1 upgrades to Pro
↓ Month 12: 1 upgrades to Enterprise

Cohort 6 Month 12 Revenue:
- 5 base customers × $500 = $2.5K
- 1 Pro customer × $2K = $2K
- 1 Enterprise customer × $5K = $5K
- Total: $9.5K (vs starting $2.5K)
- Expansion multiple: 3.8x

PATTERN: Earlier cohorts expand more (more time for expansion)
Strategy: Retain Month 1 customers to maximize expansion multiple
```

## Weekly Risk Check-In (15 min, Every Friday 5:30 PM)

### Dashboard Update
For each risk, assess:
- **Status:** Green (OK), Yellow (Warning), Red (Crisis)
- **Trend:** Up (worsening), Stable, Down (improving)
- **Action:** What are we doing about it?

### Red Flag Escalation
**If ANY risk turns Red:**
- Immediate intervention (within 24 hours)
- Root cause diagnosis
- Mitigation plan activated
- Daily tracking until resolved

### Example Red Flags & Actions

**Risk: "Runway <9 months" turns Red**
- **Action:** Immediate finance review
- **Decision Trees:**
  - If caused by higher burn: Cut costs (hiring freeze, reduce marketing spend)
  - If caused by lower revenue: Accelerate sales (founder takes more demo calls)
  - If both: Activate Series A fundraising (if not already in process)

**Risk: "Churn rate >2%" turns Red**
- **Action:** Customer success emergency
- **Decision Trees:**
  - Interview 3 recent churned customers (why did they leave?)
  - Pause new customer acquisition (focus on retention)
  - Product quality audit (are core features broken?)
  - Competitive analysis (are they choosing Weave/LangSmith instead?)

**Risk: "Anthropic launches competing product" turns Red**
- **Action:** Same-day response plan
- **Decision Trees:**
  - Assess feature parity (how much better/worse than ours?)
  - Adjust messaging (position as complementary or premium)
  - Accelerate differentiation (multi-model, enterprise compliance)
  - Contact Anthropic (acquisition conversation starter)

---

## Decision Trees (When to Pivot, Double-Down, Pause)

### Revenue Growth Decisions

**If MRR declining >15% MoM for 2+ months:**
- **Diagnosis:** Sales pipeline broken, churn increasing, or both?
- **Option A - Pause:** Stop customer acquisition, fix product/churn
- **Option B - Double-Down:** Founder takes more sales calls, aggressive discounting to close faster
- **Option C - Pivot:** Market feedback says product wrong, change direction

**Rule:** If sales/churn both broken, pause new acq (Option A). If sales broken but retention good, double-down (Option B). If retention broken, pause and fix (Option A).

---

### Fundraising Decisions

**If by Month 6, Series A still unlikely:**
- **Option A - Accelerate:** Aggressive investor outreach, reduce valuation expectations
- **Option B - Bridge:** Ask seed investors for $250-500K bridge to extend runway
- **Option C - Bootstrap:** Cut costs, slow hiring, aim for profitability instead
- **Option D - Strategic:** Approach Anthropic/AWS for strategic investment or acquisition

**Rule:** Decide by Month 6, execute chosen path immediately

---

### Product Decisions

**If feature launched but <40% adoption after 2 weeks:**
- **Diagnosis:** UI confusing? Feature doesn't solve real pain? Not well promoted?
- **Option A - Kill:** Remove feature, reallocate engineering
- **Option B - Fix:** Improve UX/documentation, relaunch
- **Option C - Educate:** Massive education campaign, in-app tips, customer training calls

**Rule:** Kill or fix within 2 weeks, not 6 months of low usage

---

### Team Decisions

**If key person (CTO, VP Sales, lead engineer) resigns:**
- **Option A - Replace:** Hire replacement immediately
- **Option B - Promote:** Elevate someone from within
- **Option C - Restructure:** Redistribute work, no replacement

**Rule:** If person is <$200K cost, replace immediately (cost of vacancy > cost of hire). If $200K+, restructure first and see if you need to replace.

## Commercial Term Negotiation Playbook

### Partner Program Benefits (What We Want)
1. **Co-Marketing**
   - Anthropic includes us in partner listings
   - Joint case studies (shared customer success)
   - Logo placement (mutual marketing materials)

2. **Technical Integration Support**
   - Priority access to new APIs
   - Early notice of breaking changes (48 hours before)
   - Anthropic engineer assigned (part-time) to help integration

3. **Sales Support**
   - Anthropic introduces us to top enterprise customers (5-10/quarter)
   - Joint sales training (Anthropic team learns about MindWeave)
   - Inclusion in enterprise RFPs (when governance is required)

4. **Investment (Series A)**
   - Anthropic invests $15-20M
   - Anthropic gets board observer seat
   - Non-exclusive partnership (we can work with others, but prioritize Anthropic)

### Negotiation Sequence

**Start with:** Co-marketing + technical support (low-risk, high-value)

**Progress to:** Sales support + customer introductions (medium commitment)

**Advance to:** Investment + board seat (highest commitment)

**Fallback Position:** If Anthropic won't invest, negotiate exclusive marketing + revenue share instead

## Integration Architecture (APIs, GTM)

### Technical Integration

**What We Integrate:**
1. **Claude API** (primary)
   - Real-time cost tracking

2. **MCP Protocol** (secondary)
   - MCP discovery
   - MCP approval workflows
   - MCP compliance

**Timeline:**
- Month 1: API integration complete
- Month 2: MCP registry integration
- Month 3: Advanced integration (predictive cost, optimization)

---

### Go-to-Market Integration

**Co-Selling Motion:**
```
Anthropic enterprise customer → Governance need identified
↓
Anthropic: "You need governance layer, try MindWeave" (warm intro)
↓
MindWeave: Sales call + trial
↓
MindWeave: Closes deal, reports back to Anthropic
↓
Anthropic: Case study collaboration (joint success story)
```

**Joint Messaging:**
```
"Anthropic + MindWeave:
Claude deployment without the compliance risk.

Claude gives you the LLM.
MindWeave gives you the governance."
```
