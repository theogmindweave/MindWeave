## DECISION FRAMEWORK CHEAT SHEET

**Before making ANY important decision, ask these 7 questions:**

1. **Timing**: Needed now or can it wait? (If wait → defer)
2. **Information**: Do I have 80% of info? (If <80% → gather more, then decide anyway)
3. **Cost**: What's the cost of being wrong? (If high → proceed to Q4)
4. **Reversibility**: Is it reversible? (If reversible → decide fast)
5. **Input**: Who else needs input? (1 person = 30 min, 4+ people = founder decides)
6. **Strategic**: Does this move us to $500K+ MRR goal? (If no → question if worth doing)
7. **Deadline**: How much time do I have? (24h = decide now, 48h = sleep on it, >1 week = deliberate)

→ **Then**: Communicate decision + rationale to team

## RED FLAGS TO WATCH (Weekly Check)

|--------|-------|--------|-----|---------------|

| Win Rate | >25% | 15-25% | <15% | Review demo quality |

| NPS | >40 | 30-40 | <30 | Product-market fit issue |
| Runway | >18 months | 9-18 months | <9 months | Accelerate revenue or cut burn |

**If ANY metric turns RED for 2 consecutive weeks:**
→ Stop everything and focus on fixing it

---

## NEXT ACTIONS (This Afternoon)

---

## KEY PRINCIPLES TO REMEMBER

1. **Execution > Strategy**
   - A good strategy executed well beats a perfect strategy executed poorly
   - Pick one script, one sales process, one feature → iterate based on results

2. **Metrics Don't Lie**
   - If metric is red, you're ignoring a real problem
   - If metric is yellow, dig deeper before it becomes red

3. **Customer Obsession > Everything**
   - Spend time with customers (not in meetings about customers)
   - Ask them what they need; build what they ask for
   - NPS + customer satisfaction > feature velocity

4. **Focus > Breadth**
   - Pick top 3 priorities per week, ignore everything else
   - Every "yes" to something is a "no" to something else
   - 80/20 rule: 20% of activities drive 80% of results

5. **Founder Discipline > Burning Out**
   - Follow the daily rhythm consistently
   - Hard stop at 6 PM (personal time matters)
   - Decisions are made during deep work, not in meetings
   - Sleep 8 hours (burnout kills startups, not hard work)
