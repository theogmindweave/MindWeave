## KEY PRINCIPLES OF THIS SYSTEM

### 1. Execution > Strategy
- A good strategy executed well beats a perfect strategy executed poorly
- Pick one script, iterate, improve
- Don't overthink; start executing

### 2. Metrics Don't Lie
- If a metric is red, you have a real problem
- Track: MRR, customers, NPS, pipeline, win rate, churn, runway, team health
- Act when metrics go yellow or red

### 3. Customer Obsession > Everything
- Spend time with customers, not in meetings about customers
- Ask them what they need; they'll tell you
- NPS + retention > feature velocity

### 4. Focus > Breadth
- Pick 3 priorities per week, ignore everything else
- Every "yes" is a "no" to something else
- 20% of activities drive 80% of results

### 5. Founder Discipline > Heroic Effort
- Follow the daily rhythm consistently
- Hard stop at 6 PM (personal time matters)
- Sleep 8 hours (burnout kills companies)
- Decisions made in deep work, not meetings

### 6. Transparency > Hidden Problems
- Share metrics with team weekly
- Celebrate wins, discuss challenges
- Red flags escalated immediately
- No surprises to investors/board

### 7. Repeatability > Uniqueness
- Build repeatable processes
- Document what works
- Train team on playbooks
- Scale what's working, kill what isn't

## RED FLAGS THAT REQUIRE IMMEDIATE ACTION

**If any of these become RED:**

|--------|-------|--------|-----|--------|
| MRR Growth | +20%+ | +10-20% | Flat/Negative | Debug sales/product |
| Win Rate | >25% | 15-25% | <15% | Review demo quality |
| Churn Rate | <1% | 1-2% | >2% | Customer success emergency |
| NPS | >40 | 30-40 | <30 | Product-market fit issue |
| Runway | >18 mo | 12-18 mo | <12 mo | Accelerate revenue or cut burn |

## COMMON QUESTIONS

### Q: Where do I start?
**A:** Read the Quick Start guide today (30 min). Follow Week 1 checklist starting Monday morning.

### Q: How much time should I spend on each domain?
**A:** Founder should spend roughly:
- 40% sales/customer
- 20% product/vision
- 20% team/operations
- 10% fundraising/partnerships
- 10% risk/financials

Adjust based on what's currently broken.

### Q: Can I customize this system?
**A:** Absolutely. The structure should stay the same, but adapt:
- Sales scripts (use your language, not verbatim)
- Feature roadmap (match your product/market)
- Financial projections (adjust based on your CAC/LTV)
- Team cadences (adjust meeting times as needed)

### Q: What if I'm not at the stage described?
**A:** That's fine. Use the principles and adapt:
- **Pre-product:** Skip product roadmap, focus on customer interviews
- **Pre-launch:** Skip sales playbook, focus on beta customer feedback
- **Pre-team:** You're doing all roles; track it as if you had team members

### Q: How often should I review/update?
**A:**
- Daily: Metrics dashboard, pipeline
- Weekly: All metrics, risk review
- Monthly: Operating rhythm audit
- Quarterly: Strategic review

### Q: What if I'm not hitting targets?
**A:** Check in this order:
1. **Execution:** Are you following the system? (Often the issue)
2. **Market:** Is there demand? (Test assumptions)
3. **Product:** Does it solve the problem? (NPS tells you)
4. **Positioning:** Are you talking to the right people? (Win/loss analysis)
5. **Timing:** Are you too early/late? (Market research)
