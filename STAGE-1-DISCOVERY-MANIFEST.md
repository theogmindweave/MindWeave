## 🎯 PRECISION SCORING FRAMEWORK

### Scoring Formula
```
PRECISION-SCORE = (InterconnectValue 0-7) + (StrategicRelevance 0-7) + (GTMImpact 0-7)
Total Range: 0-21
```

**Score Tiers:**
- **18-21:** CORE - Keep in main TheOGMindWeave, highly referenced
- **14-17:** ACTIVE - Keep in main with archive backup
- **10-13:** SUPPORT - Archive with reference trails
- **7-9:** DEPRECATED - Archive to .ogdump/DEPRECATED/
- **<7:** REMOVE - Mark for review

### Scoring Interpretation

**InterconnectValue (0-7):**
- 7: Referenced by 10+ other files, foundational
- 5-6: Referenced by 5-9 files, important linkages
- 3-4: Referenced by 2-4 files, secondary importance
- 0-2: Isolated, no cross-references

**StrategicRelevance (0-7):**
- 7: Core founder decision-making, strategic moat
- 5-6: Key operational decisions, GTM strategy
- 3-4: Supportive context, helpful reference
- 0-2: Exploratory, outdated, speculative

**GTMImpact (0-7):**
- 7: Directly affects customer acquisition, revenue model
- 5-6: Impacts sales, marketing, pricing strategy
- 3-4: Affects operations, efficiency
- 0-2: Internal process, limited external impact
