## CRISIS PROTOCOL: When Things Go Wrong

### P0 Crisis (MVP not ready by Day 14)
```
TRIGGER: Design partners can't start testing
ACTION:

- Brief design partners on new timeline
```

### P1 Crisis (NPS tracking below 35 at Week 3)
```
TRIGGER: Design partners not happy
ACTION:
- Daily iteration cycle (feedback → fix → demo)
- Focus on top 3 pain points
- Make dramatic improvement by Day 25
- Reset NPS target for Week 4
```

### P2 Crisis (GA launch slips beyond Week 6)
```
TRIGGER: MVP refinement taking longer than expected
ACTION:
- Soft launch to design partners only (extend Week 6)
- Continue iteration + refinement
- GA launch delayed 1-2 weeks max
- Adjust financial projections if needed
```

- ❌ Skip the go/no-go gates (they exist for a reason)
- ❌ Let technical debt accumulate
- ❌ Delay hard decisions
- ❌ Assume you're on track (measure everything)
