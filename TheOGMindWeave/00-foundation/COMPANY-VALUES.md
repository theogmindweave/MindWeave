# MindWeave Company Values

> The principles that guide how we work, build, and grow

---

## Overview

Values are not posters on walls—they're decisions we make every day. At MindWeave, our values emerged from the founder's experiences building teams and products, combined with learnings from companies we admire.

These values guide hiring, firing, product decisions, and how we treat customers. When in doubt, we return to these principles.

## The Six Core Values

### 1. Ship Fast, Learn Faster

> "Speed is our competitive advantage. Learning is our fuel."

**What This Means:**
- We ship weekly, not quarterly
- Perfect is the enemy of done
- Every release teaches us something
- We iterate based on customer feedback, not assumptions

**Behaviors We Reward:**
- Launching an imperfect feature that teaches us something
- Making quick decisions with 70% information
- Fixing bugs the same day they're reported
- Running experiments rather than debating

**Behaviors We Don't Accept:**
- Waiting for "one more feature" before shipping
- Spending weeks on specs without customer validation
- Debating endlessly instead of testing
- Hiding behind process to avoid decisions

**Example in Practice:**
"We launched the first version of the MCP registry in 3 weeks. It was missing half the features, but we learned that customers cared most about seeing usage metrics—something we hadn't prioritized. That insight shaped everything after."

---

### 2. Customer Obsession

> "Every decision starts with: What does the customer need?"

**What This Means:**
- We talk to customers constantly (weekly minimum)
- Customer quotes appear in every PRD
- We solve real problems, not imaginary ones
- NPS is reviewed at every all-hands

**Behaviors We Reward:**
- Engineers talking directly to customers
- Changing roadmap based on customer feedback
- Going above and beyond for customer success
- Saying "no" to requests that don't serve customers

**Behaviors We Don't Accept:**
- Building features nobody asked for
- Ignoring support tickets or feedback
- Prioritizing internal convenience over customer experience
- Making assumptions without validation

**Example in Practice:**
"A customer called frustrated that our audit logs didn't include MCP names, only IDs. An engineer jumped on a Zoom call, understood the issue, and shipped a fix the next day. That customer became our biggest advocate."

---

### 3. Ownership Over Permission

> "Act like an owner. Don't wait for permission."

**What This Means:**
- Everyone is empowered to make decisions
- We have DRIs (Directly Responsible Individuals), not committees
- "Disagree and commit" is how we resolve conflicts
- Failure from action beats failure from inaction

**Behaviors We Reward:**
- Making a decision and owning the outcome
- Fixing problems outside your "job description"
- Disagreeing respectfully, then committing fully
- Learning from failures without finger-pointing

**Behaviors We Don't Accept:**
- Waiting for someone else to decide
- Blaming others when things go wrong
- Hiding behind "that's not my job"
- Seeking consensus on every small decision

**Example in Practice:**
"Our newest engineer noticed a security vulnerability during code review. Instead of filing a ticket and waiting, they patched it immediately, wrote tests, and deployed—all in 4 hours. That's ownership."

---

### 4. Transparent by Default

> "Information should flow freely. Secrets breed politics."

**What This Means:**
- All-hands includes real financials (runway, ARR, burn)
- Board materials are shared with the company
- Salary bands are public internally
- Bad news travels fast (don't hide problems)

**Behaviors We Reward:**
- Sharing information proactively
- Admitting mistakes quickly
- Giving direct feedback (kindly, but directly)
- Asking questions when something doesn't make sense

**Behaviors We Don't Accept:**
- Hoarding information for power
- Sugarcoating bad news
- Avoiding difficult conversations
- Creating information silos

**Example in Practice:**
"When we missed our Q2 revenue target by 20%, the CEO shared the details in the all-hands within 48 hours, including what went wrong and our plan to fix it. No spin, just facts and action."

---

### 5. Excellence Without Ego

> "Be excellent at what you do, but stay humble."

**What This Means:**
- We hire the best people, who know they can always improve
- Strong opinions, loosely held
- We celebrate wins, but don't let them go to our heads
- The best idea wins, regardless of who suggests it

**Behaviors We Reward:**
- Admitting when you don't know something
- Changing your mind based on new information
- Lifting others up and sharing credit
- Continuous learning and skill development

**Behaviors We Don't Accept:**
- Arrogance or dismissiveness
- Refusing to consider other perspectives
- Taking credit for others' work
- Believing you've "figured it all out"

**Example in Practice:**
"Our VP of Sales was the most experienced person in the room, but when a junior AE suggested a different demo approach, she said, 'That's a better idea—let's try it.' The AE's approach became our standard."

---

### 6. Long-Term Thinking

> "We're building for decades, not quarters."

**What This Means:**
- We won't sacrifice tomorrow for today
- We invest in things that compound over time
- Technical debt is managed, not ignored
- Relationships matter more than transactions

**Behaviors We Reward:**
- Making decisions that benefit the company in 5 years
- Investing in documentation, tests, and infrastructure
- Building deep customer relationships
- Thinking about second and third-order effects

**Behaviors We Don't Accept:**
- Cutting corners to hit a short-term goal
- Ignoring technical debt until it explodes
- Burning bridges for quick wins
- Optimizing for metrics over real outcomes

**Example in Practice:**
"We turned down a $500K customer deal because they wanted features that would have complicated our architecture for years. Short-term painful, long-term right."

## Values in Action

### Hiring

| Value | How It Shows in Hiring |
|-------|----------------------|
| Ship Fast, Learn Faster | "Tell me about something you shipped quickly and what you learned" |
| Customer Obsession | "How do you incorporate customer feedback into your work?" |
| Ownership Over Permission | "Tell me about a time you took initiative without being asked" |
| Transparent by Default | "How do you handle sharing difficult feedback?" |
| Excellence Without Ego | "Tell me about a time you changed your mind based on new information" |
| Long-Term Thinking | "Describe a decision where you prioritized long-term over short-term" |

---

### Performance Reviews

**Exceeds Expectations (4/4):**
- Embodies all values consistently
- Helps others live the values
- Creates examples others can learn from

**Meets Expectations (3/4):**
- Lives the values in daily work
- Occasionally exemplifies values strongly
- No significant values violations

**Needs Improvement (2/4):**
- Inconsistent alignment with values
- Some behaviors contradict values
- Requires coaching and support

**Does Not Meet (1/4):**
- Regularly acts against values
- Not coachable on values
- Should transition out

---

### Conflict Resolution

When values conflict, use this hierarchy:

1. **Customer Obsession** - What's best for the customer wins
2. **Long-Term Thinking** - Avoid short-term hacks
3. **Ship Fast, Learn Faster** - Bias toward action
4. **Ownership Over Permission** - Let the DRI decide
5. **Transparent by Default** - Share the reasoning
6. **Excellence Without Ego** - Stay humble about the decision

**Example:**
"We had a debate about whether to launch a feature that was 80% ready. Customer Obsession said 'ship it—they need it now.' Long-Term Thinking said 'the last 20% is important.' We shipped, but committed to finishing the rest within 2 weeks."

---

## Anti-Values: What We Explicitly Reject

| Anti-Value | Why We Reject It |
|------------|------------------|
| **"Move fast and break things"** | Breaking things hurts customers |
| **"The customer is always right"** | Sometimes customers ask for wrong solutions |
| **"Work-life balance"** | We prefer "work-life integration"—sustainable intensity |
| **"Consensus-driven decisions"** | Consensus is slow and often mediocre |
| **"Fail fast"** | We prefer "learn fast"—failure without learning is waste |
| **"Radical candor"** | We prefer "kind directness"—candor without care is cruelty |

---

## Values Evolution

### Where These Came From

| Value | Origin |
|-------|--------|
| Ship Fast, Learn Faster | Founder's experience at previous startup where slow shipping killed products |
| Customer Obsession | Amazon influence + founder's customer-first philosophy |
| Ownership Over Permission | Netflix culture deck + frustration with bureaucracy |
| Transparent by Default | Buffer/GitLab transparency + anti-politics stance |
| Excellence Without Ego | Pixar's creative culture + Silicon Valley ego problems |
| Long-Term Thinking | Bezos's long-term orientation + sustainable business focus |

### How Values May Evolve

Values are not static. As we grow, we may:
- **Add values** if new challenges emerge
- **Refine values** based on how they play out in practice
- **Sunset values** if they become table stakes
- **Prioritize differently** as company needs change

**Process for Changes:**
1. Proposal from leadership or employees
2. Discussion at all-hands
3. 2-week feedback period
4. Final decision by executive team
5. Update documentation and training

## Living the Values Daily

### Individual Practices

- **Start each day:** "How can I embody our values today?"
- **In meetings:** "Is this decision aligned with our values?"
- **In conflict:** "Which value should guide us here?"
- **In celebration:** "What values made this success possible?"

### Team Practices

- **Weekly standups:** Share one "values win" from the week
- **Retrospectives:** Include values reflection
- **Peer recognition:** Call out values-aligned behaviors
- **Hiring:** Include values interview in every loop

### Company Practices

- **All-hands:** CEO shares values stories monthly
- **New hire onboarding:** Half-day values workshop
- **Annual review:** Company-wide values assessment
- **Exit interviews:** Understand values-related departures

|----------|--------|-----------|
| Number of values | Six | Memorable, not overwhelming |
| Values hierarchy | Yes | Helps resolve conflicts |

---

## Open Questions

1. **Enforcement:** How strictly do we enforce values violations?
2. **Culture carriers:** Should we hire specifically for values alignment?
3. **Scale:** How do we maintain values at 100, 500, 1000 employees?
4. **Remote:** How do we transmit values in a remote-first culture?
