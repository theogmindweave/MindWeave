## Team Culture Principles

### 1. Hire Slow, Fire Fast

**Rationale:**
Every early hire shapes the company DNA. We'd rather have an open role than the wrong person.

**Implementation:**
- 5-stage interview process for all roles
- Culture interview required (not just skills)
- 3-month probation period with clear expectations
- Exit underperformers quickly (with dignity)

---

### 2. Remote-First, Async-Default

**Rationale:**
Best talent is globally distributed. Synchronous meetings are expensive.

**Implementation:**
- Hire anywhere (US time zone preferred)
- Default to written communication
- Meetings require agendas, notes, and decisions
- Core hours: 10am-2pm PT for overlap

---

### 3. Ownership Over Permission

**Rationale:**
Fast-moving startups can't have bottlenecks. Everyone is empowered to act.

**Implementation:**
- Engineers deploy to production (with safety rails)
- "Disagree and commit" culture
- Failure is learning, not punishment
- Clear DRIs (Directly Responsible Individuals)

---

### 4. Customer Obsession

**Rationale:**
We build what customers need, not what we think is cool.

**Implementation:**
- Engineers talk to customers (monthly)
- Customer quotes in every PRD
- NPS reviewed weekly
- Rapid iteration based on feedback

---

### 5. Transparent by Default

**Rationale:**
Information asymmetry breeds politics. Share everything.

**Implementation:**
- All-hands weekly with financials
- Board materials shared company-wide
- Open salary bands
- 360-degree feedback loops

---

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Hire CTO vs. Promote | Hire externally | Need enterprise scale experience early |
| Remote vs. Office | Remote-first | Access global talent, reduce burn rate |
| Generalists vs. Specialists | Generalists first | Flexibility critical at early stage |
| US-only vs. Global | US + EU initially | Time zone alignment, compliance simplicity |

---

## Open Questions

1. **CTO Timing:** Hire before or after seed round closes?
2. **First Sales Hire:** AE or VP Sales first?
3. **International:** When to open EU entity?
4. **Advisory Equity:** What % to allocate to advisors?
