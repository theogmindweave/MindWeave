**Market Traction:**
- 10,000+ active Claude Code users
- $50-5,000/month pricing (freemium → Enterprise)
- Target: 100K engineers by 2027

**Why They're a Threat:**

- ❌ **No governance controls** - no team-based permissions, no policies
- ❌ **No compliance features** - no audit logs, no data residency options
- ❌ **No MCP management** - ignores the new MCP ecosystem
- ❌ **Reactive only** - measures what happened, doesn't prevent overspend
- ❌ **No team-based access** - org-wide visibility only (data exposure risk)

**MindWeave Positioning vs. Weave:**
> **"Weave measures what happened. MindWeave controls what happens next."**
- Complement their analytics with governance controls
- Position as "Weave + Governance Layer" in sales conversations
- Target compliance officers + CSISOs (Weave targets CFOs)
