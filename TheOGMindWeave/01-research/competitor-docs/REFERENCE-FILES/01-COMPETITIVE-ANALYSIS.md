## Market Insights

### Market Gaps / Opportunities for MindWeave

1. **Governance Layer Missing**
   - Adadot: No governance/compliance focus
   - Weave: Metrics only, no control/policy layer
   - **MindWeave**: Can add "with controls" angle

2. **MCP-Specific Tooling Absent**
   - Both competitors pre-date/ignore MCP ecosystem
   - MindWeave can be "MCP-native governance"

3. **Enterprise Compliance Angle**
   - Weave focuses on efficiency ROI
   - Adadot focuses on wellbeing
   - **MindWeave**: Can emphasize audit + compliance + security

4. **Model-Level Attribution**
   - Weave does tool-level (Claude vs Cursor)
   - Neither does model-level governance
   - **MindWeave**: Can do per-model + per-prompt governance

5. **Cross-Tool Integration Layer**
   - No platform unifies MCP governance across Claude, VS Code, browsers
   - **MindWeave**: Can be integration point
