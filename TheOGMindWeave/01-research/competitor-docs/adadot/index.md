worldwideDeep insights you can rely on

Every data point is benchmarked against 50,000 active developer datasets across your tooling environment.

We put each data point through 4 layers of statistical analysis & normalisation, to assure that every number is robust & properly represents your devs.

Not just for leaders

Engineering leadership is a two way street - many tools don't give the developers anything in return.

Our fitness tracker for developers & their teams is designed to build trust, autonomy, and clear representation of their work

Paint a full picture of how developers actually feel

Focusing only on work metrics doesn't necessarily show the whole story of an engineer's day-to-day.

We pull data from communication channels to better understand collaboration health, and engineering sustainability through collaboration.

Quantify the true cost of engineering initiatives on people and code

◉ Is quality suffering?

◉ Are our developers overworked?

◉ Is there enough focus time in the day for our developers to produce quality code?

Uncover the areas where engineering effort is invested

◉ Are we investing our efforts at the right places?

◉ Are we spending too much time on bugs?

◉ Is Slack messaging getting too distracting?

Manage the board’s expectations and protect your developers

◉ How likely are we to deliver this feature on time?

◉ How accurately are we scoping / planning projects?

◉ Could we be faster at reviewing code?

Decide on the best tradeoffs with “What if” scenario analysis backed by causal data models

◉ What would happen to our Lead Time if the developers attended 2 fewer hours of meetings per week?

◉ What if all Pull Requests were reviewed in under 24 hours? How would that affect team velocity?

◉ How does the time it takes for a Pull Request (PR) to be reviewed correlate with the amount of review comments it has?
