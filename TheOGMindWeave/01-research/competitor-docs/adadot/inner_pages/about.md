A stellar team of developers, hackers and designers! Some have known each other for years and some are new but everyone gets on really well. Adadot prides itself on having an open recruiting policy; we don’t focus on degrees and formal qualifications. Instead, we recruit based on proprietary tests that we have developed in-house and often we will take a bet on potential.
