Qnew report said earlier this week that Apple is working
                                                    on a
                                                    brand
                                                    new laptop.
                                                    Apple plans to release a 15-inch MacBook Air in 2023, a
                                                    first for
                                                    the Air
                                                    series. A trusted Apple insider with a proven track
                                                    record
                                                    confirmed
                                                    that Apple
                                                    is working on the larger MacBook Air.

However, Apple might not include it in the Air series
                                                    when it
                                                    launches it. As for
                                                    the notebook’s release date, the 15-inch MacBook isn’t
                                                    coming soon.
                                                    It’ll get a
                                                    late 2023 release at best, according to the new claims.

What sizes do MacBook Airs come in?

Apple currently sells only one MacBook Air size. The
                                                    laptop
                                                    comes in
                                                    a 13-inch
                                                    version that matches the pre-2021 13-inch MacBook Pro
                                                    size.
                                                    Previously, Apple
                                                    sold an 11-inch MacBook Air, but the company
                                                    discontinued
                                                    that model
                                                    in 2017.

And the day came when the risk to
                                                    remain
                                                    tight in a bud was more painful than the risk it took to
