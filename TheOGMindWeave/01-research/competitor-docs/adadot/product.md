As you are reading this you might be thinking ofsome of these things:

I’ve seen other developer tools, why is this one different.

Software development is not only about code, oversimplifications do not work.

I don’t work like others, so no point in trying to help me in the same way as others.

You lost me on metrics/analytics. Too bored to look into charts and dig for what I need.

Being a developer is more than code.

We take into account your communications, meetings, and your professional wellbeing patterns to train our AI models, as well as show you your data.

We are not using a one-fits-all approach.

All our models are trained individually on your data. Furthermore, we use multiple models and choose the ones that work best for you. So the insights, and recommendations we give you are for you personally.

Our AI models perform causal analysis

Combined with flow prediction, we provide you with the what and the why, so you never have to go digging for it.

All data are transformed

From project-based, repo-based, issue-based, etc to you-based, so you can be the centre of our data and our analyses.

Automated data inputs

Waste no time on manual input.
Adadot automates the process through its powerful integrations. Get accurate data faster than ever before simply by connecting the tools that you use daily.

Privacy

Adadot never processes or stores code.

                                                    We also never store or process Slack messages and we do not access emails at all.
                                                    Individual metrics are always aggregated and anonymised at the team level.
                                                    Team metrics can only be accessed when there are only three team members and above in a team in order to protect privacy.

Security

SOC2 and GDPR compatible.
                                                    Frequently penetration tested. Encrypted data. Multi tenant databases and all the other good security stuff.
