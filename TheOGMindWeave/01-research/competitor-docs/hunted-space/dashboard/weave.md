I'm Adam, Co-Founder and CEO of Weave, and we're excited to share our launch with you today!

What is Weave?

Engineers are adopting coding tools like Cursor, Windsurf, and Claude Code without any way to measure if they're actually getting better results.

Weave changes that. We're an engineering intelligence platform that tells you exactly how well you're using AI and shows you how to improve.

What makes us different?

We built two complementary product suites:

🔧 AI Setup Optimization

- Comprehensive AI adoption checklist covering everything from tool selection to team training
- Cursor rules linter that analyzes your GitHub repositories and optimizes your rules files for better AI performance
- Ensures your foundation is solid before focusing on usage improvements

📊 AI Usage Analytics

- Weave Score metric that tracks your actual engineering productivity over time
- Automatic detection of AI-generated code across all popular tools (Cursor, Windsurf, Devin, Greptile, Claude Code)
- Smart suggestions on which tasks should have been handled with AI
- ROI calculations that convert your AI adoption into dollar savings

Why we built it?

We originally launched as a general engineering productivity tool, but kept hearing the same question: "How do I know if my AI investment is paying off?"

After hundreds of conversations, we realized teams desperately needed visibility into their AI usage. Some engineering teams are 10x more productive with AI tools, while others barely see improvement. The difference isn't the tools themselves, it's how they're being used.

We decided to build the analytics layer that was missing.

What you get:

✅ Clear metrics on AI tool effectiveness
✅ Actionable recommendations for improvement
✅ Financial ROI tracking for your AI investments
✅ Optimization for your existing AI setup
✅ Detection across all major AI coding platforms
✅ Individual and team-level insights

We're launching today for engineering leaders who want to maximize their AI investments and individual developers looking to level up their AI skills.

We'd love to hear your feedback and thoughts on how you're currently measuring AI effectiveness at your company.

Let's make AI adoption more intentional and a lot more profitable. 🤖✨
