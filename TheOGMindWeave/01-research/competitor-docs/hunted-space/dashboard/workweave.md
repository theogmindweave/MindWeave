We are thrilled to introduce WorkWeave, a tool built to turn any engineer into a 10x engineer. 

Our Story:

Early in our careers, we realized the immense value of timely and constructive feedback and self-awareness.

When we had a good manager, the awareness and insights from feedback propelled us to new heights, helping us refine our skills and achieve our goals. 

When we had a bad manager, we received delayed and inconsistent feedback that frustrated us in our careers and hindered our performance. 

Determined to give everyone access to that feedback and awareness an amazing manager gives, we built WorkWeave (https://app.workweave.ai). It’s designed to empower engineers with the feedback they need, exactly when they need it. 

Our Solution:

At WorkWeave, we believe that continuous feedback and self-awareness are key drivers of personal and professional growth. We have built this tool to help engineers thrive in their careers.

WorkWeave bridges this gap by providing real-time, data-driven performance feedback tailored specifically for engineers. Here’s how:

1. Real-Time Performance Insights: Gain immediate visibility into your coding performance with metrics that matter.
2. Actionable Feedback: Receive specific, constructive feedback that helps you understand areas of strength and opportunities for improvement.
3. Personalized Growth Plans: Develop a clear roadmap for your career progression based on your unique performance data.
4. Reduce Stress & Build Relationships: See how stressed you are, what’s causing your stress, and how it affects your team. 
5. Automated Performance Reviews & 1:1’s: Automatically generate your performance review to show your manager your accomplishments and growth. 

When we tested with our beta users, the feedback was clear. Performance dramatically improved, and relationships were built thanks to the insights & actionable feedback provided. 

Join us on this journey to elevate engineering performance and create a culture of continuous improvement. 

Give us a try, and let’s weave the future of work together!

Thank you,
The WorkWeave Team (Adam & Andrew)
