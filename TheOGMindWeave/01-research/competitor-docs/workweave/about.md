# Weave - AI to measure AI

> Weave combines LLMs and domain-specific machine learning to understand engineering work. We understand how much work was done by AI vs. humans. How much AI is helping your team ship faster, if it's having an impact on code quality and code reviews.

Our values

Our values

Our values

We’re building tools to help carbon and silicon work together.

Do whatever it takes.

We set hard goals every week and do whatever it takes to achieve them.

Listen to our customers.

We have a shared Slack channel with every customer. It's a race to respond & ship based on customer requests.

Everyone see's everything

The best way to make decisions is to get as much context as you can. Since everyone is constantly making decisions, we share everything going on in the company openly. Financials, customers, etc.

Don't shy away from solving the hardest problems first.

In a world of "hacks" we've decided to focus on the hardest problems first. From the first product being an "impossible" task to our pricing model always being monthly, we've always made it harder for ourselves up front so we can expedite learnings.
