# Announcing Our $4.2M Seed Round - Remote

> Weave combines LLMs and domain-specific machine learning to understand engineering work. We understand how much work was done by AI vs. humans. How much AI is helping your team ship faster, if it's having an impact on code quality and code reviews.

At Weave, we're building engineering analytics for the AI era. Historically, engineering teams have operated blind to their actual productivity. Traditional metrics like lines of code or story points tell you nothing about real output, and existing tools weren't built for a world where AI is generating significant portions of code. We believe the future belongs to teams that can measure what actually matters: how much engineering work gets done and how effectively AI is being used.

That's why today we're excited to announce that we've raised a $4.2M seed round led by Moonfire and Burst Capital, with participation from Y Combinator.

Our Journey

After interviewing 134 engineers across different companies we realized engineering leaders knew their teams were using AI tools like Cursor and Claude, but they had no visibility into whether these investments were actually paying off. Meanwhile, traditional engineering metrics were becoming increasingly meaningless as AI-generated code started making up larger portions of codebases.

We knew that measuring engineering work required understanding the actual content and complexity of what engineers build, not just counting commits or tracking velocity. With the recent breakthroughs in AI models we could actually analyze code contributions to create a accurate measure of engineering output.

In January, we built the AI models that can quantify engineering work by analyzing every pull request, understanding context, and measuring real output. Since then, we've been able to work with teams ranging from two-person startups to major enterprises. 25% of new Y Combinator companies are now using Weave, and we're seeing engineering leaders get the visibility they need to optimize their teams and AI investments.

What's Next

Since launching Weave, we've been focused on showing that objective engineering measurement is possible and valuable. The response from engineering teams has validated our approach. Going forward, we'll accelerate product development to serve teams of all sizes, from individual engineers looking to improve their own productivity to enterprises optimizing entire engineering organizations.

We're building the definitive platform for engineering analytics in the AI era. As AI tools become standard across all engineering teams, the ability to measure and optimize their impact will become essential for competitive advantage.

The future of engineering is here. Now we can finally measure it
