$4.2M seed round led by Moonfire, Burst Capital & Y Combinator

You're staring at another sprint retrospective where the same issues keep popping up. Your team's velocity is inconsistent, code reviews are taking forever, and you're not even sure if you're measuring the right things. Sound familiar?

Here's the thing –**most engineering leaders face this exact dilemma**. You know you need better visibility into your team's performance, but should you build your own software development metrics platform or buy one off the shelf?

I've been in those shoes. You're juggling deadlines, managing stakeholder expectations, and trying to keep your team productive. The last thing you want is to make the wrong call on tooling that affects your entire engineering organization.

Let's break down this build vs buy decision so you can make the right choice for your team.

Why Software Development Metrics Platforms Matter

Before diving into the build vs buy debate, let's get clear on what we're talking about. A**software development metrics platform**helps you:

Track team velocity and throughput
- Identify bottlenecks in your development process
- Monitor code quality and technical debt
- Measure developer productivity and satisfaction
- Analyze deployment frequency and lead times

Without proper metrics, you're basically flying blind.Research from Google's DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA) team shows that high-performing teams deploy 208 times more frequently[1]than low performers, but how would you know where your team stands without the right measurement tools?

The Case for Building Your Own Platform

Complete Control and Customization

When you build internally, you get exactly what you need. No compromises, no feature requests sitting in someone else's backlog for months.

**Key advantages:**

**Perfect fit for your workflow**– Design around your specific Git workflows, CI/CD processes, and team structure
- **Custom metrics**– Track exactly what matters to your organization, not what a vendor thinks matters
- **Integration flexibility**– Connect seamlessly with your existing toolchain
- **No vendor lock-in**– You own the code, the data, and the future direction

Cost Considerations for Large Teams

Here's where the math gets interesting. For larger engineering teams (100+ developers), building internally might actually save money in the long run.

Most commercial platforms charge per developer per month. Let's say you're looking at $50/developer/month for a decent platform. For a 200-person engineering team, that's $120,000 annually. Over three years, you're looking at $360,000+ just in licensing fees.

Real-World Success Stories

Companies like Netflix, Spotify, and Uber have built sophisticated internal platforms.Netflix's engineering productivity team has created custom dashboards that track everything from deployment frequency to code review times[2], giving them insights that no off-the-shelf solution could provide.

The Reality Check: Why Building Is Harder Than It Looks

The Hidden Complexity

Building a comprehensive metrics platform isn't just about pulling data from your Git repos and JIRA. You need:

**Data pipeline architecture**that can handle multiple sources
- **Real-time processing**for up-to-date metrics
- **Robust APIs**for integrations
- **User-friendly dashboards**that actually get used
- **Data governance**and security controls
- **Scalable infrastructure**as your team grows

The Time Investment

Let's be realistic about timelines. A basic internal platform might take 3-6 months to build with a dedicated team of 2-3 engineers. But getting to feature parity with commercial solutions? You're looking at 1-2 years of development time.

That's 1-2 years where those engineers could be working on your core product instead.

Ongoing Maintenance Burden

Here's what nobody talks about enough –**maintenance is expensive**. Your homegrown platform needs:

Regular updates as your toolchain evolves
- Bug fixes and performance optimization
- Feature enhancements as requirements change
- Documentation and onboarding for new team members

Studies show that maintenance typically accounts for 60-80% of total software costs[3]over the lifetime of an application.

The Case for Buying: Why Commercial Solutions Make Sense

Time to Value

This is where commercial platforms really shine. Instead of months of development, you can have actionable insights in days or weeks.

**Weave, for example, can be up and running in under an hour**, connecting to your existing Git repositories and immediately providing insights into team performance, code review bottlenecks, and delivery patterns.

Battle-Tested Features

Commercial platforms have been refined based on feedback from hundreds or thousands of engineering teams. They've solved problems you haven't even encountered yet.

Focus on Your Core Business

Every hour your engineers spend building internal tooling is an hour not spent on features that drive revenue. Unless you're in the business of selling engineering metrics platforms, this probably isn't your core competency.

Proven ROI

Research from McKinsey indicates that organizations using advanced analytics see a 19% increase in earnings before interest and taxes[4]. But only if you're actually using the platform effectively – which is easier when someone else handles the technical implementation.

Key Factors to Consider in Your Decision

Team Size and Resources

**Small teams (5-25 developers)**: Buy almost always makes sense. The overhead of building and maintaining a custom solution outweighs the benefits.
- **Medium teams (25-100 developers)**: Could go either way depending on your engineering culture and available resources.
- **Large teams (100+ developers)**: Building might make financial sense, but only if you have the appetite for a multi-year commitment.

Technical Expertise

Do you have engineers with experience in:

Data pipeline development
- Analytics and visualization
- DevOps toolchain integrations
- Building scalable web applications

If not, the learning curve adds significant time and risk to your build decision.

Regulatory and Security Requirements

Some industries have strict requirements around data handling and vendor management. If you're in healthcare, finance, or government, building internally might be necessary for compliance reasons.

Making the Right Choice for Your Organization

Here's my framework for making this decision:

Choose**Build**if:

You have 200+ developers and a budget for a dedicated platform team
- Your workflow is highly unique and can't be supported by existing solutions
- You have specific compliance requirements that vendors can't meet
- You're willing to invest 2+ years in development and ongoing maintenance

Choose**Buy**if:

You want to focus engineering resources on your core product
- You need insights quickly (within weeks, not months)
- Your team size is under 200 developers
- You prefer predictable monthly costs over large upfront investments

The Hybrid Approach: Best of Both Worlds

Here's something worth considering – you don't have to choose just one approach. Many successful companies start with a commercial solution like**Weave**to get immediate value, then gradually build custom extensions or integrations as needed.

This gives you:

**Immediate time-to-value**from day one
- **Proven foundation**to build upon
- **Flexibility**to customize what matters most
- **Risk mitigation**if your build efforts take longer than expected

Why Weave Stands Out in the Buy Category

When evaluating commercial options,**Weave**offers several advantages that make the buy decision easier:

**LLM-powered analysis**that goes beyond basic metrics to provide contextual insights
- **Quick setup**with minimal configuration required
- **Domain-specific machine learning**trained specifically for software development workflows
- **Comprehensive coverage**from individual contributor performance to team-wide bottlenecks
- **Actionable insights**rather than just dashboards full of numbers

The platform tracks everything from code review patterns to delivery bottlenecks, giving you the visibility you need without the years of development time.

The Bottom Line

Building your own software development metrics platform can work, but it's a significant commitment that goes far beyond the initial development effort. For most organizations, buying a proven solution delivers faster ROI and lets you focus on what you do best.

The question isn't really whether you can build a metrics platform – it's whether you should. Unless you have compelling reasons to build (massive scale, unique requirements, or regulatory constraints), your time and engineering resources are probably better invested in your core product.
