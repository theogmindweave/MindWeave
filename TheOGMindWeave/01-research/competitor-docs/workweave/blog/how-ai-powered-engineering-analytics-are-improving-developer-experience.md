# How AI Powered Engineering Analytics Are Improving Developer Experience - Remote

> Weave combines LLMs and domain-specific machine learning to understand engineering work. We understand how much work was done by AI vs. humans. How much AI is helping your team ship faster, if it's having an impact on code quality and code reviews.

Ever been in a meeting where everyone's arguing about whether the team is "being productive" but nobody can actually prove what's happening? Yeah, we've all been there. And honestly, it's gotten worse since AI tools entered the picture.

Here's what's really going on: while more development teams perceive they're gaining more time from AI, they're also reporting greater organizational inefficiencies than before. That disconnect between what feels productive and what actually moves the needle forward? That's exactly where**engineering productivity analytics**becomes game-changing.

Developers tend to be happier when they can be productive. When a developer experiences friction, it's a sign that they can't deliver as much value as they feel they could. And right now, there's a lot of hidden friction in how we measure and understand engineering work.

Why Developer Experience Matters More Than Ever

The traditional approach to measuring developer productivity has always been… well, let's just say it could use some work. 'If you can't measure it, you can't manage it.' But are you measuring the wrong thing? For as long as there have been computer programmers, there have been stupid metrics used to measure them.

The problem isn't just bad metrics – it's that developers who cite "inefficient work processes" as a top work challenge are 2x as likely to report feeling unproductive and 67% more likely to be looking for other jobs.

That's where Weave comes in. Weave combines LLMs and domain-specific machine learning to understand engineering work, giving you the kind of visibility that actually helps developers do their best work.

The Current State of Engineering Analytics Software

Most software development metrics platforms today are stuck measuring the easy stuff – lines of code, commit counts, story points. But here's the thing: they rely on metrics like lines of code (correlation with effort: ~0.3), number of PRs, or story points (slightly better at ~0.35). These metrics are, frankly, terrible proxies for productivity.

Developer experience encompasses how developers "feel about, think about, and value their work," and focuses on the everyday realities and friction that developers face while performing their work. Traditional metrics completely miss this human element.

**Weave**takes a fundamentally different approach. We run LLMs and our own models on every PR and review, analyzing both output and quality. We integrate with all AI coding tools (Claude, Cursor, etc.) and have PR level code attribution to determine what was written by AI, what wasn't, and what should've been.

How AI-Powered Analytics Transform Developer Experience

Here's where**engineering productivity analytics**gets interesting. Instead of just counting things, AI can actually understand what's happening in your codebase.

Real Understanding of Engineering Work

This isn't a line of code calculator, this is an actual estimate of the key metric: "How long would it take an experienced engineer to make this change?"**Weave**goes beyond surface-level metrics to understand the actual complexity and value of engineering work.

The platform addresses something most teams struggle with: Engineering leaders are flying blind. They can't dive in everywhere, so they need to rely on gut feel or shoddy metrics to try to get a handle on what's going on and what needs fixing. Engineering is unique in that there are no good metrics to solve this problem.

Better Visibility Into Team Dynamics

**Weave**shows you things like how much time each engineer is spending on code review and how helpful their reviews are: See output across individuals to identify top performers, see how new hires are ramping and if anyone is blocked.

This isn't about micromanaging – it's about understanding where friction exists so you can actually fix it.

AI Integration That Makes Sense

Teams like Reducto, Superpower and Laurel use Weave to ship 16% more, just 2 months after using Weave. We show you who your top AI performers are (so they can share best practices), how the team stacks up against its competitors and the real financial return of your AI investments.

Self-Improvement Is Easier

When you can actually see how much you are getting done, and how you compare to others on your team and in the industry, you can finally get a clear picture of how good you are and where you need to improve. Junior engineers can stop guessing if they are working hard enough or if what they are doing is actually good.

What Modern Engineering Analytics Look Like

The best**engineering analytics software**combines multiple approaches:

Focus on Developer Experience Dimensions

The DevEx framework distills the factors affecting developer experience into three dimensions: feedback loops, cognitive load, and flow state. These dimensions matter more than traditional velocity metrics.

Balanced Measurement Approaches

Measuring developer productivity requires a balanced approach—combining quantitative metrics (like cycle time and deployment frequency) with qualitative insights (developer satisfaction, collaboration). While frameworks like DORA, SPACE, and Developer Velocity Index (DVI) provide structured methodologies, teams should customize their approach based on workflows and business needs.

AI-Enhanced Understanding

This is where**Weave**really shines. By combining LLMs with machine learning models tailored to software engineering, Weave delivers nuanced insights that go beyond traditional metrics, addressing the unique challenges of tracking productivity and impact in environments where AI assistance is increasingly common.

Real Impact on Developer Experience

When you implement proper**engineering productivity analytics**, here's what actually happens:

Reduced Context Switching

From both a productivity and personal-experience standpoint, maximizing the amount of time developers spend in the inner loop is desirable: building products directly generates value and is what most developers are excited to do.

Better Recognition and Career Growth

A manager noticed that code review quality has the highest correlation to output. He reset code review standards and team output went up by 15%. When you can actually see quality contributions, you can recognize and reward them properly.

Data-Driven Process Improvements

However, you can use perceptual and workflow measurements to track and improve feedback loops, cognitive load, and flow state. Using KPIs to improve these 3 dimensions will get you happier developers who help your organization achieve its goals.

Getting Started with AI-Powered Engineering Analytics

If you're ready to move beyond guesswork and gut feelings, here's what to look for in an**engineering analytics software**platform:

**Real understanding of code complexity**– not just line counting
- **AI integration insights**– understanding how AI tools impact your workflow
- **Individual and team visibility**– seeing both performance and blockers
