# Individual vs. Team Engineering Dashboards (Key Features) - Remote

> Weave combines LLMs and domain-specific machine learning to understand engineering work. We understand how much work was done by AI vs. humans. How much AI is helping your team ship faster, if it's having an impact on code quality and code reviews.

- ## ## 1. - **Tool Capabilities:**Look for engineering performance tracking solutions that:

**Integrate Seamlessly:**Ensure compatibility with your existing development stack, including Git repositories (like GitHub), project management tools (like JIRA)
- **Provide Timely Data:**Real-time or near real-time data is crucial for making informed, timely decisions.
- **Offer Clear Visualizations:**Customizable, interactive dashboards with intuitive charts and graphs make data easier to understand and act upon[2].
- **Deliver Actionable Insights:**The best tools go beyond raw data, helping to pinpoint bottlenecks, suggest improvements, and highlight successes[2].
- **Support Multiple Perspectives:**Ideally, a platform should offer flexibility to view data at both team and individual levels, if your strategy requires it.

Conclusion

Both individual and team engineering dashboards offer distinct and invaluable perspectives for understanding, managing, and enhancing engineering performance. Team dashboards provide the essential macro view for strategic planning, process optimization, and identifying systemic challenges. Individual dashboards, when implemented thoughtfully, offer a micro view that is crucial for personal growth, targeted coaching, and empowering developers.

The most effective engineering analytics strategy often involves a synergistic approach, leveraging both types of dashboards to create a comprehensive, data-informed picture. This empowers everyone, from individual contributors to senior engineering leaders, to make better decisions.

Ultimately, remember that metrics and dashboards are not ends in themselves. They are tools to facilitate meaningful conversations, drive continuous improvement, and foster a healthy, engaged, and high-performing engineering culture.
