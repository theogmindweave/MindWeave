Counting pull requests or tracking DORA metrics was a great start, but in the age of AI, it feels like trying to measure a rocket's performance with a car's speedometer. To truly understand team performance, you need analytics that can see beyond the surface.

Growing engineering teams need insights that help them scale effectively. The old way of looking at metrics often misses the nuance of complex software development. It's time for a new approach that leverages AI to provide a clearer, more accurate picture.

Weave

**Weave**is an engineering analytics platform built for the AI era. It uses a combination of large language models (LLMs) and custom machine learning to analyze the substance of your engineering work, not just the volume. By looking at every pull request and code review, Weave provides a measure of engineering effort, categorizes work automatically, and benchmarks your team's performance against industry standards. It's designed to give you "X-ray vision" into your team's performance.

Hatica

Hatica is an engineering management platform that pulls data from your development tools to create dashboards. It focuses on established frameworks like DORA and SPACE metrics to help teams track velocity, alignment, and well-being across the software development lifecycle.

What Happens When You Switch to Weave?

Moving to an AI-driven platform isn't just about getting new charts; it's about unlocking real, measurable improvements.

**20% Lift in Output:**Companies have reported a 20% increase in engineering output after identifying and removing bottlenecks with Weave's insights.
- **94% Accuracy to Actual Effort:**Weave's AI model has demonstrated a 0.94 accuracy to actual engineering effort, compared to traditional metrics like lines of code (which hover around 0.3).

What Sets Weave Apart in the AI Era

Weave is purpose-built to give engineering leaders the clarity they've been missing. It moves beyond counting activities to understanding the value and complexity of the work itself.

Weave's AI provides visibility into engineering efforts by automatically classifying work into categories like new features, bug fixes, and maintenance, so you know exactly where your team's time is going.

**Measure Effort, Not Just Activity**

Lines of code and PR counts are unreliable proxies for productivity.**Weave**answers a more powerful question: "**How long would this PR take an expert engineer?**". This standardized metric allows for fair comparisons and accurate planning, helping you identify performance bottlenecks before they derail your roadmap.

**Boost Performance & Developer Experience**

**Weave's**confidential benchmarks help you understand your team's performance in a non-punitive way By automating busywork and highlighting areas for improvement, like code review standards, you can foster a culture of continuous growth and keep your developers focused on building great software.

Make Data-Driven Decisions with Confidence

**Weave’s**platform is built on a foundation of enterprise-level security, including**SOC 2 Type I certification**, ensuring your data is always encrypted and safe. You get actionable, reliable insights to drive strategy, justify headcount, and connect engineering work directly to business outcomes.

In the end, the choice comes down to what you want to measure. Do you want to track process, or do you want to measure output?
