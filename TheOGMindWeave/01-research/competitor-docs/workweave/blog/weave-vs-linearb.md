Engineering teams today have access to numerous tools designed to provide insights into development workflows and team performance. Two notable options in this space are LinearB and Weave. Both platforms aim to help engineering leaders make data-driven decisions, but they take different approaches to achieving this goal.

Go Beyond Automation, Lead with Intelligence

LinearB has established itself as a solid choice for teams looking to track workflow metrics and gain visibility into their development processes. The platform provides comprehensive dashboards and helps teams understand their delivery patterns through automated data collection from tools like Jira and GitHub.

Weave takes a different approach by focusing on AI. Rather than stopping at workflow automation, Weave attempts to provide deeper insights into the quality and impact of engineering work. They do this by scanning every PR and answering the questions “how long would it take an expert engineer to complete this?” The result is 94% accuracy in measuring objective output per engineer.
