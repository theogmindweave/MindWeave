# Weave vs. Pluralsight Flow | AI engineering metrics - Remote

> Weave combines LLMs and domain-specific machine learning to understand engineering work. We understand how much work was done by AI vs. humans. How much AI is helping your team ship faster, if it's having an impact on code quality and code reviews.

Ever feel like you're drowning in engineering metrics but still can't answer the most important questions? You can see your team's cycle time and deployment frequency, but you don't know if they're shipping high-impact features or just chasing minor bugs. It's a common problem. You have data, but not necessarily insight.

This is the core difference when you look at engineering intelligence platforms. On one side, you have tools like**Pluralsight Flow**, which are great at tracking the*activity*within your development process. On the other, you have a new generation of AI-powered platforms like**Weave**, which analyze the*actual work*being done to give you a much deeper understanding of quality, complexity, and impact.

Let's break down the two approaches.

The Comparison: Workflow Metrics vs. AI-Powered Analysis

Choosing the right tool depends on what you want to achieve. Are you looking to simply visualize your current workflow, or are you looking to fundamentally understand and improve the value your team delivers?

While platforms like Pluralsight Flow offer a solid foundation in developer-focused metrics, they primarily focus on the "what" and "when" of your workflow. They track commits, pull requests, and review cycles, giving you a dashboard of your team's activity. This is a good first step.

But**Weave**takes it to the next level. It's not just about tracking activity; it's about understanding it.**Weave uses AI to scan every single pull request**, analyzing the code for complexity, quality, and purpose. This provides leaders with detailed insights into team performance that go beyond simple counts.

Here’s a quick breakdown of the different philosophies:

Capability

Pluralsight Flow (The Traditional Approach)

Weave (The AI-Powered Approach)

**Core Focus**

Measures developer workflow and activity metrics (DORA, cycle time).

Measures engineering output, quality, and complexity using AI.

**Productivity Metric**

Based on activity counts like commits, lines of code, or PRs merged.

Based on an AI-estimated effort, comparing the work to what an experienced engineer would produce.

**Code Analysis**

Tracks the process around the code (e.g., review time).

Analyzes the code itself to categorize work (new features, bugs, tech debt) and assess quality.

**Key Insight**

"How fast is our process?"

"How much value are we shipping, and is it high quality?"

**Best For**

Teams starting their metrics journey, focused on visualizing their SDLC.

Teams looking for deep, objective insights to optimize performance and align with business goals.

For engineering leaders searching for alternatives to traditional activity tracking tools, the choice often comes down to this distinction between activity tracking and true, AI-driven work analysis.

Your Engineering Intelligence Journey Starts with AI

While traditional metrics give you a map of your process, AI gives you a GPS with real-time traffic analysis. It doesn't just show you the road; it helps you find the best route.

1. Go Beyond Activity to Measure True Productivity

A common issue with metrics like commit frequency or lines of code is that they don't account for complexity. A 10-line bug fix isn't the same as a 1,000-line new feature, but many tools treat them similarly.

**The Old Way:**You see a high number of commits and assume the team is productive. But are they working on the right things? Is the work challenging or just busywork?
- **The Weave Way:**Weave uses custom machine learning models trained on expertly-labeled pull requests to estimate the effort required for a given change. This gives you a normalized, objective measure of productivity that isn't easily gamed. You can finally see the difference between a team that's busy and a team that's effective.

2. Understand Your Investment with Automatic Work Categorization

Where is your engineering time*really*going? Answering this question is critical for strategic planning, but it's often a manual, painful process of tagging tickets.

**The Old Way:**You rely on developers to correctly label every Jira ticket, which is inconsistent at best. You get a fuzzy picture of resource allocation.
- **The Weave Way:**Weave's AI automatically analyzes the code and PR descriptions to categorize work into buckets like**new features, bug fixes, tech debt, and maintenance**. You get a clear, real-time view of your engineering investment without adding any process overhead for your team.

3. Improve Code Reviews with Deeper Insights

Slow code reviews are a classic bottleneck. Traditional tools can tell you*how long*a PR was in review, but not*why*.

**The Old Way:**You see a PR is stuck. Is it because the change is massive? Is the reviewer overloaded? Or is there a knowledge silo? You have to manually investigate.
- **The Weave Way:**By analyzing the code's complexity and the substance of review comments, Weave helps you pinpoint the root cause. It can highlight PRs that are disproportionately complex, identify potential knowledge gaps, and show you how effective your review process actually is at improving code quality.

4. Connect Engineering Work to Business Outcomes

Ultimately, engineering leaders need to translate their team's work into business value. This is where many platforms can fall short if they only provide siloed engineering metrics.

**The Old Way:**You present DORA metrics to the board, but they struggle to see how "Deployment Frequency" connects to revenue or customer satisfaction.
- **The Weave Way:**Weave is built on an enterprise-grade AI for decision management. By providing objective data on what's being built (features vs. bugs), the complexity of that work, and its quality, Weave gives you the tools to have meaningful conversations with business stakeholders. You can show how engineering efforts are driving the product forward and make data-backed cases for strategic investments.

Are You Ready to See the Full Picture?

Choosing an engineering intelligence platform is a big decision. Tools like Pluralsight Flow have paved the way by giving teams visibility into their workflows. But the future of engineering leadership isn't just about visibility—it's about deep, contextual understanding.

If you're ready to move beyond counting activities and start analyzing the value and quality of your team's work, an AI-powered approach is the next logical step.
