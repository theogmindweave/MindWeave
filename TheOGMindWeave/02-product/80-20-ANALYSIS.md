## DECISIONS: Apply 80/20

### What We're Doing

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Claude-only (no GPT/Gemini) | 80% of target market |
| SSO-only auth | 80% of enterprise requirement |
| Token dashboard first | 80% of customer pain |
| 3 integrations max | GitHub, Slack, Okta = 80% coverage |

### What We're NOT Doing

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| No mobile app | <5% use case |
| No on-prem (MVP) | Complex, low demand |
| No custom branding | Vanity feature |
| No webhooks (MVP) | API is enough |

## METRICS: 20% Metrics → 80% Insight

### Track These Only

| Metric | Why It Matters |
|--------|----------------|
| MRR/ARR | Revenue health |
| Active Users (DAU/MAU) | Product usage |
| NPS | Customer satisfaction |
| Time to Value | Onboarding success |
| Churn Rate | Retention |

### Ignore (For Now)

| Metric | Why Skip |
|--------|----------|
| Page views | Vanity |
| Social followers | Vanity |
| Feature usage (detailed) | Too early |
| A/B test results | Need volume first |
