**Interviewee:** John, VP Engineering
**Company Size:** Fortune 500 (500+ engineering team)
**Claude Status:** 200+ engineers with access (9 months, no governance)

**Key Pain Points:**
- Zero visibility: "I literally don't know what 200 people are doing with Claude"
- Budget risk: "CFO asked about spend. I gave him a number, but I wasn't confident"

**What They're Looking For:**
1. HIPAA BAA (with MindWeave + Anthropic)
2. Audit logs for 6+ years (PHI access tracking)
3. Role-based access (patients data restricted to healthcare staff)
4. Data residency (US-only initially, EU expansion later)
