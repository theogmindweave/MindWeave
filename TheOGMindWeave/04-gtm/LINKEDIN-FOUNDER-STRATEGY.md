# LinkedIn Founder Voice Strategy for MindWeave

## Executive Summary

Based on analysis of 179 LinkedIn posts from Adam B. Cohen (WorkWeave founder/CEO) spanning December 22-24, 2025, we've identified a highly effective founder positioning playbook that MindWeave should adapt for market penetration and thought leadership.

**Key Insight:** WorkWeave has achieved 10,000+ engineers across 500+ companies tracking by building a founder voice that combines market data, product validation, and authentic company building stories. MindWeave should adopt a similar approach with emphasis on AI governance and compliance challenges (WorkWeave's blind spot).
