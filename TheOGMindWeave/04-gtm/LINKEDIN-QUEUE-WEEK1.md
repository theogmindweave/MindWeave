## POST SEQUENCE (7 Days)

### DAY 1 (LAUNCH DAY): Announcement Posts (2 posts)

**POST #1: Launch Announcement (9 AM PT)**
```
🚀 We're launching MindWeave today.

For 2 years, we asked enterprise CTOs the same question:
"How much are you spending on Claude?"

Answer: "I don't know."

That's the problem MindWeave solves.

In 2 weeks, you'll have:
✅ Real-time visibility into Claude usage (who, how much)
✅ Cost attribution by team (finally answer your CFO)
✅ Audit logs for compliance (pass that SOC 2 audit)
✅ MCP registry (stop building the same integration 3 times)

We're starting with 2 design partners:
→ Fortune 500 SaaS company (200 engineers)
→ Mid-market financial services (compliance-driven)

Both went from zero visibility to complete governance in 2 weeks.

Ready to see how much you're really spending on Claude?

**POST #2: The Problem (2 PM PT)**
```
Real conversation we had yesterday:

VP Engineering: "I have 200 people with Claude access."
Me: "How much are you spending?"
VP Engineering: "No idea. CFO asked. I guessed $50K/month."
Me: "Is it?"
VP Engineering: "Could be $200K. Could be $10K. I genuinely don't know."

This is the #1 problem we're hearing from enterprises.

Not "Claude is too expensive"
Not "We don't trust AI"

Just: "We have zero visibility"

The cost breakdown:
- No one's tracking who uses it
- No one's tracking how much they use
- When you finally look, you're shocked
- Then you panic
- Then you make rushed decisions

We built MindWeave to fix this.

In 2 weeks, that VP will know exactly:
→ Who's using Claude
→ Which projects consumed the most tokens
→ Which teams are overspending
→ Where to optimize

That's the difference between chaos and control.

### DAY 2-3: Problem Validation (2 posts)

**POST #3: The Duplicate MCP Problem (9 AM PT)**
```
We analyzed 500+ companies deploying Claude.

Found a pattern:

Average company size: 300 engineers
Average number of MCPs: 8
Average number of duplicates: 3

Translation: That Salesforce integration you built?
→ Engineering team built it
→ Sales team rebuilt it
→ Marketing team rebuilt it again

Cost: $150K+ in duplicate engineering work

Our newest design partner (StartupX, 300 engineers):
→ Found 8 MCPs
→ Identified 3 clear duplicates
→ Prevented rebuilding the 4th

How many duplicate MCPs are in your org right now?

You probably don't know. That's the problem.

MindWeave's "hivemind" algorithm detects duplicates in minutes.

**POST #4: The Compliance Wake-Up Call (3 PM PT)**
```
SOC 2 auditor asked our design partner:

"Do you have governance controls for your Claude deployment?"

Answer: "Uh... no. We literally just let people use it."

Auditor: "That's a risk. Document it."

2 weeks later, they deployed MindWeave.

Now they have:
✅ Audit logs (who accessed Claude when)
✅ Team-based permissions (segregation of duties)
✅ Compliance dashboard (ready for auditors)
✅ Regulatory roadmap (SOC2, HIPAA, GDPR)

Their auditor: "Perfect. We're good."

EU AI Act enforcement is 8 months away.
Your auditor will ask you this question.

Are you ready?

### DAY 4-5: Solution Showcase (2 posts)

**POST #5: The Dashboard Demo (9 AM PT)**
```
Here's what MindWeave gives you in 2 weeks:

[IMAGE: Dashboard screenshot showing usage by engineer, team, project]

Real numbers from our design partner (F500 company):

Week 1: "Wow, John's team is consuming 40% of our Claude tokens"
Week 2: "And they're spending on 3 redundant MCPs"
Week 3: "That's a $200K optimization opportunity"

What took them 3 months to investigate manually, we found in 2 weeks.

Key metrics you'll see:
✅ Total tokens consumed (trending)
✅ Cost per team (attribution)
✅ Cost per engineer (benchmarking)
✅ Top projects (ROI tracking)
✅ Audit events (compliance)

Most CTOs we talk to are shocked by what they find.

"We were spending 3x what we thought."
"Sales team was overprovisioned."
"This project was dead but still burning Claude credits."

The problem wasn't knowing.
The solution is seeing.

**POST #6: The Team Governance Angle (2 PM PT)**
```
CTO just told us:

"Finance team shouldn't see sales data through Claude. That's a security risk."

But everyone has access to the same Claude account.

So either:
A) Finance can't use Claude (lose productivity)
B) Everyone uses Claude (security risk)
C) You need team-based permissions (governance)

Option C is why governance matters.

MindWeave lets you:
✅ Give Finance access to Claude
✅ Prevent them from seeing Sales MCPs
✅ Log what they access (compliance)
✅ Audit everything (security)

It's not about blocking people.
It's about smart access control.

"Empower teams while protecting data."

That's the balance we're striking.

### DAY 6-7: Credibility + CTA (2 posts)

**POST #7: The Founder Story (9 AM PT)**
```
Why we built MindWeave:

I was at a F500 company. CTO asked: "How much are we spending on Claude?"

IT director: "Millions."
Finance: "Could be $50K."
Engineering: "Who cares, it's productive."

No one knew.

I asked: "Why don't we have visibility?"
Answer: "No tool exists."

I spent the next 6 months building one.

Then I left and started MindWeave.

Talked to 8 enterprise CTOs. They all said the same thing:
"We need exactly this. When can we have it?"

2 design partners signed LOIs before we shipped anything.

That's when I knew: This isn't a nice-to-have.
It's a must-have.

Governance isn't a compliance check box.
It's how you run Claude at enterprise scale.

Today, we're launching.

If you're deploying Claude across 50+ engineers, you need governance.

Not next quarter.
Now.

**POST #8: Design Partner Testimonial (3 PM PT)**
```
Design Partner Quote:

"We went from zero visibility to complete governance in 2 weeks.

Before MindWeave:
- No one knew who was using Claude
- CFO asked how much we spent, we guessed
- We had duplicate MCPs across teams
- Our auditor flagged governance as a risk

After MindWeave:
- Dashboard shows real usage
- Cost attribution is accurate
- Duplicates identified (prevented future builds)
- Audit logs ready for compliance

This is how you run Claude at enterprise scale."

**POST #10: The Vision (3 PM Day 7)**
```
By 2027, enterprise AI governance will be as standard as

SSL certificates.
SOC 2 audits.
Role-based access control.

Companies will ask:
"Do you have AI governance?"

Like we ask: "Do you have HTTPS?"

Right now (2025), we're in the before.

Most enterprises:
❌ No visibility (black box)
❌ No controls (open access)
❌ No audit trails (no proof)
❌ No compliance path (risk)

By 2027, this will be unacceptable.

MindWeave is building the standard.

"Governance isn't compliance.
It's how you run at scale."

We're just getting started.
