## DOMAIN 1: CUSTOMER ACQUISITION MECHANICS (The Exact Playbook)

### Email Subject Lines That Work (80%+ Open Rate Target)

**SUBJECT TEMPLATE:**
```
AI governance for [Company Name]

Hi [Name],

I've been tracking your AI deployment - saw the blog post about scaling
Claude across 200+ engineers. That's impressive.

One thing I wonder: how are you managing governance as it scales?
Cost visibility, compliance, duplicate work detection?

We built MindWeave specifically for that. Quick 15-min call?

[Link to calendly]

—
[Your Name]
Founder, MindWeave
mindweave.ai
```

**Why It Works:**
- References specific company activity (shows research, not mass email)
- Asks questions instead of pitching (respects their time)
- Time-bounded (15 min, not open-ended)
- Direct calendly link (removes friction)
- Signature includes title + company (social proof)

**Measurement:** Track 40%+ open rate, 15%+ reply rate

**Iteration:** A/B test 2 versions, scale winner weekly

---

### Value Props by Persona (Copy/Paste Ready)

**For CTO/VP Engineering:**
> "2 weeks to visibility + governance. Most teams estimate internal build takes 6 months and costs $200K in dev time. We're $50K/year."

**For CISO/Security:**
> "SOC 2 Type II ready at launch, with audit logs ready. We also have GDPR and HIPAA on the roadmap."

**For CFO:**
> "Most companies we talk to are spending 2-3x what they thought on Claude because there's zero visibility. We usually show a 40% reduction in overall spend through cost attribution and budget controls."

**For Compliance Officer:**
> "EU AI Act enforcement is Aug 2026 - 8 months away. MindWeave gives you the governance controls you need - audit logs, segregation of duties, approval workflows."

**Application:** Paste exact script into email, customize company name only

**Measurement:** Track which persona converts highest, double-down on that messaging

---

### Exact Call-to-Action Language (Close-Specific)

**Discovery Call CTA:**
> "Based on what you've seen in the trial, you mentioned [success criteria]. We've demonstrated [capability]. The Pro tier at $2,000/month gives you [benefits]. Are you ready to move forward?"

**POC CTA:**
> "Let's prove it with a POC. 2-week free trial. No commitment. After POC, you'll see ROI clearly. Then decide if it makes sense."

**Why It Works:** Assumes sale, offers proof, removes risk in that order

**Measurement:** Track CTA conversion rate (target: 60%+ who hear CTA convert)

---

### Exact Outreach Sequence (Day by Day)

**Day 1:** Initial email (template above)
**Day 3:** Follow-up: "Checking if you saw my note about AI governance?"
**Day 7:** Value-add: "Saw [Company] just announced [AI initiative]. Governance is critical here."
**Day 14:** Break-up: "Haven't heard back. Should I close your file?"
**Day 30:** Re-engage: "New case study from [similar company]. Thought you'd find interesting."

**Conversion Target:** 6% overall (1 in 16 outreach → customer)

**Timing:** Send Day 1 email at 9 AM PT Tuesday (optimal for B2B response)

---

### Demo Script (30-Min Structure, Minute-by-Minute)

**OPENING (0-3 min):**
- Confirm attendees and their roles

- Set agenda: "By the end, you'll see how MindWeave solves [their specific pain]"

**ACT 1: Dashboard (3-8 min) - THE HOOK**
- Login with SSO
- Show overview metrics
- Call out: "In 30 seconds, you see what used to take hours"
- Pause for reactions

**ACT 2: Token Analytics (8-13 min) - THE VALUE**
- Usage trends and cost patterns
- Cost attribution by team
- Model comparison (Opus vs Sonnet vs Haiku)
- Call out: "This is where customers find 30-40% savings"

**ACT 3: MCP Registry (13-18 min) - THE DIFFERENTIATION**
- Discover all deployed tools
- Show approval workflows
- Security scanning results
- Call out: "Complete visibility into your AI tool stack"

**ACT 4: Compliance (18-23 min) - THE ENTERPRISE SEAL**

- Export for auditors
- Call out: "Meet your compliance requirements automatically"

**CLOSE (23-30 min) - THE DECISION**
- Summarize 3 key values seen
- Pricing overview ("Pro tier $2K/month based on team size")
- Propose next step (trial, POC, security review)
- Lock in timeline ("By Friday?")

**Do's:** Pause frequently for questions, customize examples to their company, focus on 3-4 key capabilities
**Don'ts:** Rush through features, show every feature, generic walkthrough

**Measurement:** Track demo-to-trial conversion (target: 60%), demo duration (target: 30±3 min)

---

### Exact Pricing Scripts (Handle Every Scenario)

**Annual Discount Script:**
> "I can offer 15% off annual if we close by Friday"

**Trial Extension:**
> "Let's extend 1 week to address [specific issue]"

**Pilot Scope Reduction:**
> "Let's start with one team and prove value before full rollout"

**ROI Justification:**
> "At your spend, that's $X savings/month. MindWeave often pays for itself in month 1"

**Measurement:** Track discount usage rate vs conversion impact

---

### Follow-Up Cadence (When to Follow Up, What to Say)

**If They Ghost (3+ days silence):**
> "Checking in. Should I close your file or is there still interest?"

**If They Stall (interested but indecisive):**
> "What's holding us back? Let's address it directly."

**If They're Interested (clear buying signals):**
> "Great! I'll send over the agreement for signature. Should we walk through the terms on a call first?"

**Timing:**
- Day 1: Immediate thank you + next step
- Day 3: Check-in if no response
- Day 7: Value reminder
- Day 14: Final push or close file professionally

**Measurement:** Track response rate by follow-up type (target: 15%+ reply rate on each follow-up)

---

## DOMAIN 2: PRICING PSYCHOLOGY & OPTIMIZATION

### Anchor Pricing (Strategic Sequencing)

**Strategy:** Always anchor on Enterprise tier first, then show Team tier as accessible option

**EXACT SCRIPT:**
> "Most companies your size invest $5K/month for enterprise governance. For teams starting out, we have a Team tier at $500/month."

**Psychology:** Makes $500 feel like bargain compared to $5K anchor

**When to Use:** Initial pricing conversation, never lead with lowest price

**Measurement:** Track what % of customers accept first-proposed tier (target: 70%)

---

### Discount Decision Matrix

**WHEN TO OFFER:**
- End of quarter push (Month 3, 6, 9, 12)
- Competitive threat (customer evaluating Weave)
- Strategic account (logo value, reference potential)
- Multi-year commitment

**HOW MUCH:**
- Annual prepay: 10-15% (auto-approved by founder)
- Multi-year (2yr): 15-20% (CTO/VP approval needed)
- Multi-year (3yr): 20-25% (Board approval)
- Startup program: 50% Year 1, 25% Year 2 (design partners only)

**TO WHOM:**
- Design partners: 50% Year 1 (in exchange for case study + reference)
- Competitive displacement: 20% max (don't leave money on table)
- Strategic accounts: 25% + logo rights (enterprise customers)
- No discounts: Single-year commitments from well-funded companies

**Justification Script (When Customer Asks for Discount):**
> "For design partners willing to share learnings and provide references, we offer 50% off Year 1."

**Measurement:** Track discount usage rate (target: <30% of deals get discount), discount impact on NRR

---

### Tiering Strategy (Free vs Pro vs Enterprise)

**TEAM TIER** ($500/month)
- Up to 20 seats
- Core: cost dashboard, MCP registry, basic audit logs
- Support: Email only
- **Purpose:** Land small teams, prove value, expand

**PRO TIER** ($2,000/month)
- Up to 100 seats
- Advanced: SSO, analytics, API access, Hivemind detection
- Support: Chat + prioritized response
- **Purpose:** Growing companies with multiple dev teams

**ENTERPRISE TIER** ($5K+/month)
- Unlimited seats
- Premium: SCIM provisioning, custom integrations, 99.9% SLA, dedicated CSM
- Support: Phone + named CSM
- **Purpose:** Large enterprises with compliance requirements

**Expansion Hooks (Move Customers Up Tier):**
- Team → Pro: Need >20 seats? → Upsell
- Team → Pro: Need SSO? → Upsell
- Pro → Enterprise: Need >100 seats? → Upsell
- Pro → Enterprise: Need SCIM? → Upsell

**Measurement:** Track upgrade rate per tier (target: 15%+ Team → Pro per quarter)

---

### Willingness-to-Pay Signals (Pricing Adjustment)

**HIGH WILLINGNESS (Premium Pricing, No Negotiation):**
- Recent compliance audit failure (regulatory urgency)
- CFO asking about AI costs (budget allocated)
- Security incident related to AI (budget emergency)
- Regulatory deadline approaching (Aug 2026 EU AI Act)

**MEDIUM WILLINGNESS (Standard Pricing, Minor Negotiation OK):**
- Exploring governance proactively
- Multiple teams using Claude (clear pain)
- Growing engineering org (future expansion)

**LOW WILLINGNESS (Discount Required or Skip):**
- Early-stage startup (<30 people)
- Pilot program only (no budget for production)
- Budget constraints mentioned upfront (CFO says no)

**Application:** Score prospect on these signals during discovery, adjust pricing approach

**Measurement:** Track conversion rate by willingness score (target: 80% close rate on HIGH willingness)

---

### Negotiation Thresholds (When to Give Ground, When to Hold)

**WHEN TO GIVE GROUND:**
- Customer has competitive quote (show superior value)
- Multi-year commitment offered (lock in predictable revenue)
- Strategic logo value (recognizable enterprise customer)
- End of quarter/year (hit revenue target)

**WHEN TO HOLD FIRM:**
- Customer hasn't shown budget authority (need to involve CFO)
- Discount >25% without clear justification (not sustainable)
- Month-to-month billing requested (need commitment)
- No willingness to be reference/case study (logo value zero)

**EXACT SCRIPT FOR HOLDING FIRM:**
> "I understand budget matters, but at that price point, we can't deliver the value you need. Let's structure a deal that works for both of us."

**Measurement:** Track discount resistance rate (target: hold firm 60% of time)

---

## DOMAIN 3: COMPETITIVE WIN SCENARIOS (Exact Battle Cards)

### vs. DIY/Internal Solutions

**CUSTOMER PAIN POINT:** "Building takes too long, diverts engineering from product"

**OUR COUNTER:**
> "Many teams estimate 6 months to build internally. That's $200-300K in dev cost. MindWeave is $50K/year. Your time isn't free."

**IF THEY SAY:** "It's free to build ourselves"

**SAY BACK:**
> "What's the opportunity cost of 2-3 months of platform work? Your team could ship 3-4 product features instead. Focus your custom work on your product, not governance tools."

**CLOSING LANGUAGE:**
> "What if you could have full governance tomorrow instead of in 6 months? What would that be worth?"

**PROOF POINT:**
> "Company X initially planned to build internal Claude tracking. After 3 months and 2 engineers, they had basic logging but no analytics, no MCP support, and no compliance features. They switched to MindWeave and were fully operational in 2 days."

**Measurement:** Track win rate vs DIY objection (target: 80% convert)

---

### vs. LangSmith/Generic Observability

**POSITIONING:** "Governance is not observability"

**EXACT SCRIPT:**
> "LangSmith is great for observability - you can see what happened. MindWeave controls what CAN happen - governance, compliance, cost controls. You need both, or choose the specialist."

**IF THEY SAY:** "We already use LangSmith"

**SAY BACK:**
> "Great - we complement LangSmith for AI governance. Use both. LangSmith shows infrastructure health. We show AI governance health. Where's LangSmith's MCP management? Cost optimization? Team-based access control?"

**CLOSING LANGUAGE:**
> "Specialization wins. You wouldn't use Datadog for CRM. AI governance deserves purpose-built tooling."

**PROOF POINTS:**
- Feature comparison: MindWeave MCP governance (5-star), LangSmith (0-star)
- Pricing: MindWeave 40-60% less for AI-focused use case
- Case study: DevTools chose MindWeave over LangSmith for compliance

**Measurement:** Track win rate vs LangSmith (target: 65% convert)

---

### vs. Weave (Category Competitor)

**POSITIONING:** "Different job to be done"

**EXACT SCRIPT:**
> "Weave shows what happened (analytics). We control what can happen (governance + compliance). Analytics ≠ governance."

**IF THEY SAY:** "Weave does what you do at lower price"

**SAY BACK:**
> "Weave is good at analytics. But governance requires team-based access control, compliance audit logs, approval workflows, MCP management, role-based permissions. Weave doesn't have those. If you just want dashboards, use Weave. If you need governance + compliance, use MindWeave."

**SPECIFIC GAPS IN WEAVE:**
- ❌ No team-based access control
- ❌ No compliance audit logs
- ❌ No approval workflows
- ❌ No MCP management
- ❌ No role-based permissions

**CLOSING LANGUAGE:**
> "Try both in your POC. You'll see the difference in 30 days."

**Measurement:** Track win rate vs Weave (target: 55% convert, more conversions happen after POC)

---

### vs. Do Nothing/Status Quo

**POSITIONING:** "Cost of inaction grows exponentially"

**OPENING SCRIPT:**
> "Every day without governance is another day of untracked costs and risk. Average 30-40% wasted AI spend. Compliance risk growing with EU AI Act enforcement in 8 months."

**IF THEY SAY:** "We're fine for now / Not a priority"

**SAY BACK:**
> "Here's what's coming in 18 months: EU AI Act enforcement (Aug 2026), customers demanding governance proof, cloud giants entering market. Your window to be first is closing. Now is best time to implement before urgency hits."

**ROI CALCULATOR (Concrete Numbers):**
```
50-person engineering team:

CURRENT STATE:
Claude Spend: $15,000/month
Waste from suboptimal model use: 30% = $4,500/month
Manual time tracking: 40 hrs/mo = $6,000/month
Total Hidden Cost: $10,500/month

WITH MINDWEAVE:
MindWeave Pro: $2,000/month
Cost optimization savings: -$4,500/month
Time saved: -$6,000/month
Net Benefit: $8,500/month

6-MONTH ROI:
Savings: $51,000
Cost: $12,000
Net Benefit: $39,000 ✅
```

**CLOSING LANGUAGE:**
> "What's your Claude spend today? Project 6 months out. Every month of delay = more cleanup later."

**Measurement:** Track "do nothing" conversion rate (target: 70% move to POC)

---

### Post Templates (Copy/Paste, Customize Company Names Only)

**TEMPLATE 1: Data Insight Post**
```
We analyzed 50+ companies and found a massive blind spot: 73% can't audit their Claude usage by team.

This creates 3 problems:
1. Uncontrolled spending (average 30% waste)
2. Compliance violations (no audit trail)
3. Duplicate work (teams building same MCPs)

The governance gap is real. And expensive.

[COMMENT HOOK: How are you tracking AI governance today?]
```

**TEMPLATE 2: Customer Win Post**
```
Design partner win: [TechCorp] went from zero MCP visibility to full governance in week 1.

Results:
- 47 duplicate MCPs identified
- $150K/year in wasted engineering cost
- 2-hour audit time (was 2 weeks)

Governance isn't overhead. It's ROI.

[COMMENT HOOK: What's your biggest AI governance challenge?]
```

**TEMPLATE 3: Founder Journey Post**
```
We built the MVP in 2 weeks. Here's what surprised us:

1. Customers cared MORE about compliance than cost
2. MCP duplication was 3x worse than expected
3. Security reviews completed in 2 weeks (not 3 months)

Month 1 learnings that shaped our roadmap.

[COMMENT HOOK: What surprised you about your market?]
```

---

### Engagement Tactics (Algorithmic Momentum)

**RULE:** Respond to every comment in first 2 hours (sets algorithmic momentum)

**ASK QUESTIONS THAT ENCOURAGE DISCUSSION:**
> "How is your team handling AI governance today?"

**SHARE COUNTER-PERSPECTIVES RESPECTFULLY:**
> "Interesting take. Here's what we're seeing in the data..."

**HIGHLIGHT FOLLOWERS WHO ENGAGED:**
> "Great point by @username on compliance timing"

**Measurement:** Track comment-to-like ratio (target: 10% of likes = comments), engagement rate

---

### Content Repurposing Workflow (1 Post → 5 Assets)

**Single LinkedIn Post generates:**

**1. Blog Post** (1,500 words, deep dive)
**2. Podcast Episode** (25 min interview)
**3. YouTube Short** (60 sec data visualization)
**4. Email Sequence** (3-part: Problem → Solution → Case Study)
**5. Twitter Thread** (condensed for different audience)

**WEEKLY SCHEDULE:**
- Monday: LinkedIn post published
- Tuesday: Blog expansion goes live
- Wednesday: Email segment 1 goes out
- Thursday: Podcast/YouTube releases
- Friday: Twitter threads posted

**Measurement:** Track content reuse metrics (how many assets generated per original post)

---

## DOMAIN 6: UNIT ECONOMICS STRESS TESTING

### Baseline Healthy Economics (Current Model)

**PER CUSTOMER:**
- ACV: $10,000/month
- Gross Margin: 75%
- CAC: $5,000
- CAC Payback: 20 days (0.67 months)
- LTV: $180,000 (24-month lifetime)
- LTV:CAC: 36:1 (exceptional health)
- Monthly Churn: 0.5%
- NRR: 115%

**INTERPRETATION:** Exceptionally healthy unit economics justify 3x spending on growth

---

### What If CAC is 2x Higher? ($5K → $10K)

**NEW ECONOMICS:**
- CAC Payback: 1.33 months (stretched but OK)
- LTV:CAC: 18:1 (still healthy, >3:1 needed)

**SURVIVAL MECHANISM:**
- Reduce CAC through partnerships (Anthropic channel)
- Increase ACV through upsells
- Acceptable if customer acquisition rate increases 2x

**DECISION RULE:** Only proceed if acquiring 2x customers at $10K CAC

**Trigger:** Monitor CAC monthly, alert if 2x for 2 months

---

### What If NRR Drops to 105%? (115% → 105%)

**IMPACT:**
- Slower growth from existing customers
- Need more new customers to hit revenue targets
- LTV decreases (affects fundraising narrative)

**RESPONSE PLAN:**
1. Build expansion features (multi-model support, premium tiers)
2. Focus customer success (reduce churn immediately)
3. Increase new customer acquisition (offset with volume)

**TRIGGER:** If NRR <105% for 2 consecutive months, execute expansion feature roadmap

**Measurement:** Track NRR weekly, NPS monthly (leading indicator)

---

### What If Churn Spikes to 2%? (0.5% → 2%)

**IMPACT:**
- LTV drops from $180K → $90K (50% hit)
- LTV:CAC drops from 36:1 → 18:1 (still healthy but concerning)
- Business model stress but technically viable

**DIAGNOSTIC QUESTIONS (Immediate):**
1. Why are customers churning? (product issues, competitive pressure, price)
2. Which cohorts churn? (early vs later, by company size)
3. What's the pattern? (first month vs later, seasonal)

**RESPONSE PLAN (Immediate):**
1. Customer success intervention for at-risk accounts
2. Product quality improvements
3. Competitive response (pricing, features)

**RED LINE:** If churn >3% for 2 months, pause new customer acquisition and fix retention first

**Measurement:** Track churn rate weekly by cohort, NPS by customer

---

### What If We Can't Raise Series A?

**SCENARIO:** Series A delayed beyond Month 9

**PATH B (Bootstrap to Profitability):**
1. Extend runway by hitting $150K MRR (vs $50K)
2. Slower hiring (delay VP Sales hire)
3. Focus on profitability, not growth
4. Target: $200K MRR = break-even

**CASH IMPACT:**
- Current burn: $250K/month
- Revenue at Month 9: $200K MRR
- Net burn: $50K/month
- Extended runway: 18 months (instead of 12)

**DECISION:** Path B is viable if unit economics hold

**Trigger:** By Month 7, if no Series A traction, activate Path B immediately

---

### What If Anthropic Launches Competing Product?

**SCENARIO:** Anthropic announces native governance in Month 12

**IMMEDIATE PIVOT PLAN:**
1. **Differentiate:** Multi-model support (not just Claude)
2. **Deepen:** Enterprise compliance features Anthropic won't build
3. **Accelerate:** Acquisition discussions with Anthropic before launch
4. **Expand:** Microsoft/AWS partnerships as alternative

**ACQUISITION CONSIDERATION:** If Anthropic offers $200M+, seriously evaluate

**Trigger:** Product announcement from Anthropic, activate pivot within 1 week

---

### What If First 5 Customers All Churn?

**SCENARIO:** Design partners don't convert or churn early

**IMMEDIATE DIAGNOSIS (Week 1):**
- Product doesn't solve problem? (fundamental issue)
- Pricing wrong? (affordability issue)
- Wrong customer segment? (targeting issue)

**RESPONSE (Week 1-2):**
1. Pause new customer acquisition
2. Deep customer interviews (WHY did they leave?)
3. Product pivot if fundamental issue found
4. Don't spend more until product-market fit proven

**RED LINE:** If NPS <20 after 5 customers, fundamental product issue exists

**Measurement:** Track NPS per customer, churn by cohort, reason for churn

---

## DOMAIN 7: CONTENT STRATEGY (Exact Outlines)

### Blog Post Structure (Example: "The Enterprise AI Audit Gap")

**HEADLINE:** "The Enterprise AI Audit Gap: Why 73% of Companies Are Non-Compliant"

**HOOK (100 words):**
"Your next audit will ask about AI governance. Can you answer? Most companies can't. 73% of companies deploying Claude enterprise-wide have zero audit trail capability. Here's why that matters."

**PROBLEM (400 words):**
- 73% of companies can't audit Claude usage by team
- EU AI Act enforcement (August 2026) requires audit capability
- Current audit for unprepared companies: $50K+ cost
- Compliance violations can result in fines

**SOLUTION (400 words):**
- MindWeave provides complete audit trail in 2 weeks
- Case study: [TechCorp] passed SOC 2 audit with MindWeave
- Specific capabilities: audit logs, access controls, export for auditors

**CALL TO ACTION (100 words):**
"Download our AI Audit Readiness Checklist and see where you stand"

**MEASUREMENT:** Track blog post metrics (views, time on page, CTA clicks, leads generated)

---

### Twitter Thread Template (MCP Duplication)

```
1/7 We analyzed 50+ companies using Claude.

Found something shocking: 47% of MCPs are duplicates.

Here's what that costs you 🧵

2/7 Team A builds "Customer Database Query" MCP
Team B builds "Query Customer DB" MCP
Team C builds "Get Customer Info" MCP

Same capability. Three different implementations.

3/7 Cost breakdown:
- Engineering time: 40 hours per MCP
- Maintenance: 5 hours/month ongoing
- 3 duplicates = 120 hours wasted = $18,000

Per quarter.

4/7 Multiply across 10-20 common MCPs:
$180K-360K per year in duplicate work.

Most companies have zero visibility into this.

5/7 The governance gap is real.

Without central MCP registry:
❌ No discovery
❌ No deduplication
❌ No cost tracking
❌ No consolidation

6/7 Solution: Hivemind detection engine

Automatically finds similar MCPs
Recommends consolidation
Tracks savings

Results: 30-40% reduction in duplicate work

7/7 Want to see how many duplicate MCPs your team has?

Free audit: [link]

We'll show you exactly where duplication is costing you.

### Decision-Making Checklist (7 Questions)

**Before making ANY decision, ask:**

**Q1: Is this decision required NOW or can it wait?**
- If "wait" → Defer (preserve decision energy)
- If "now" → Proceed to Q2

**Q2: Do I have 80% of information needed?**
- If <80% → Gather more data (24-48 hours max)
- If 80%+ → Proceed to Q3

**Q3: What's the cost of being wrong?**
- If low → Decide fast
- If high → Proceed to Q4

**Q4: Is this reversible or irreversible?**
- If reversible → Decide fast (change course later)
- If irreversible → Proceed to Q5

**Q5: Who else needs input?**
- 1 person → 30 min discussion
- 2-3 people → 60 min discussion
- 4+ people → Skip consensus, founder decides

**Q6: Does this move us toward Month 7 goal ($500K+ MRR)?**
- YES → Prioritize (do immediately)
- NO → Question if worth doing
- UNCLEAR → Discuss with 1 trusted advisor

**Q7: What's the decision deadline?**
- <24 hours → Decide now
- 24-48 hours → Sleep on it (subconscious processing)
- >48 hours → Deliberate thoughtfully

**DECISION MADE:** Communicate decision to team with rationale

## DOMAIN 9: SALES PROCESS MICRO-TACTICS

### Objection Handling (10 Scripts, Use Verbatim)

**OBJECTION 1: "We can build this ourselves"**
```
I understand. Many teams consider that initially. What's your team's
capacity for internal tools?

Here's what we typically see: Internal builds take 6+ months and cost
$200-300K in dev time. With MindWeave, you're live in 30 minutes.

The question is: build vs buy opportunity cost. Your team could ship
3-4 product features instead of spending 6 months on governance tooling.

Would a 14-day trial let you compare our solution to your planned build?
```

**OBJECTION 2: "We're too early for governance"**
```
Governance can sound heavy. When do you expect your AI usage to grow?

Early visibility prevents later problems. Teams that wait have 3x the
cleanup cost.

Start with Team tier ($500/month) - grow when ready. The foundation
matters more than the timing.
```

**OBJECTION 3: "Price is too high"**
```
Budget matters, let's understand the value. What's your current Claude spend?

Average customer saves 35% on token costs through optimization. At your
spend, that's $X savings/month.

MindWeave often pays for itself in month 1. Let me show you the math...
[Pull out ROI calculator]
```

**OBJECTION 4: "We use OpenAI, not Claude"**
```
Many teams use multiple models. Are you exploring Claude at all?

Multi-model is the future. We're expanding to other providers. Let's
stay in touch as your stack evolves.

[If they show interest in Claude: "When you do explore Claude, we'll
be ready."]
```

**OBJECTION 5: "Security review will take months"**
```
Enterprise security is thorough. I appreciate that. We can accelerate it:
- SOC 2 Type II certified
- Pre-filled security questionnaire ready
- Dedicated security contact for fast response

Most customers move from 6-month reviews to 4-week reviews with our docs.

Let's get security docs shared today. You can start POC while review
is happening.
```

**OBJECTION 6: "This isn't a priority right now"**
```
Understood. You're not in urgent pain yet. Here's what's coming in
18 months:
- EU AI Act enforcement (Aug 2026)
- Customers demanding governance proof
- Compliance auditors asking questions

Now is best time to implement before urgency hits.

Want to check back in 90 days? Or better - let's do a 2-week POC now
so you're ahead of the curve.
```

**OBJECTION 7: "Anthropic might build this"**
```
That's a fair question. Let me give you perspective.

Anthropic is focused on LLM research + models. Governance is an
operational tool - different focus.

We're positioned as Anthropic's governance partner, not competitor.
If Anthropic enters, we integrate with them.

You're not locked in - we're your governance partner regardless of
Anthropic's roadmap.
```

**OBJECTION 8: "Weave does what you do at lower price"**
```
Weave is good at analytics. But analytics ≠ governance.

- Weave shows what happened (measurement)
- We control what can happen (governance + compliance)

Specific gaps Weave doesn't have:
- Team-based access control
- Compliance audit logs
- Approval workflows
- MCP management
- Role-based permissions

If you just want dashboards, use Weave. If you need governance +
compliance, use MindWeave.

Try both in your POC. You'll see the difference.
```

**OBJECTION 9: "Want to see multiple references"**
```
Smart. You want proof from similar companies. I can connect you with:
- Large SaaS company (TechCorp reference)
- Financial services (FinanceInc reference)
- Mid-market startup (StartupX reference)

What specific use case do you want to reference?

Let me connect you with [relevant company] this week.
```

**OBJECTION 10: "Need to talk to my team/boss"**
```
Of course, this is a team decision. Who would need to be involved?

[Get list: CTO, CFO, Compliance Officer]

Can I send you a 1-pager to share with them? Or would a quick 30-minute
group call work better?
```

### Demo Script (Minute-by-Minute, Use Exactly)

**OPENING (0-3 min):**
```
Thanks for taking the time. Just to confirm - are [Name] and [Name]
here as well? Great.

From our earlier conversation, I understand your biggest challenge is
[specific pain they mentioned]. By the end of this 30 minutes, I'm going
to show you exactly how MindWeave solves that.

Sound good?
```

**ACT 1: Dashboard (3-8 min) - THE HOOK**
```
Let me start with the dashboard. I'm going to log in with SSO - this
takes 30 seconds [do it].

The first thing you see is your cost overview. In 30 seconds, you can
see:
- Total spend this month: $250K
- Cost trend: Up 15% vs last month
- Top expensive models: Opus consuming 40% of budget

In most companies, this takes 2+ weeks to assemble manually.

[Pause for reaction. Wait 5 seconds. If they look impressed, continue.
If skeptical, ask: "What would be most valuable to see here?"]
```

**ACT 2: Token Analytics (8-13 min) - THE VALUE**
```
Now let's dig deeper. I'm going to show you cost attribution by team.

[Click into Team view]

Here's Team A: $80K/month spend
Here's Team B: $55K/month spend
Here's Team C: $25K/month spend

But here's where it gets interesting. Team A is using Claude Opus 80%
of the time, when 90% of their work could be done with Sonnet at 20%
the cost.

By switching Team A to Sonnet, you'd save $48K/month. That's $576K/year.

That's where customers find 30-40% savings.

[Pause. Ask: "Does that match what you're seeing in your costs?"]
```

**ACT 3: MCP Registry (13-18 min) - THE DIFFERENTIATION**
```
Now let me show you the MCP Registry - this is where you get complete
visibility into your AI tool stack.

[Pull up registry]

You can see all 47 MCPs deployed across your teams:
- 30 are approved and in production
- 12 are in testing
- 5 are pending security review

Notice something? We've highlighted these 3 MCPs as duplicates. They all
do the same thing: "Query Customer Database." They're just implemented
by 3 different teams.

That's $150K/year in wasted engineering time on duplicate work.

[Pause. Ask: "How many duplicate efforts like this do you think exist
in your org?"]
```

**ACT 4: Compliance (18-23 min) - THE ENTERPRISE SEAL**
```
Last thing - compliance. This is where the enterprise value really shows up.

[Pull up audit logs]

Every action is logged: Who accessed what MCP, when, and why. This is
exportable for your auditors.

You have role-based access control - you can assign different permissions
to different teams. Finance sees cost data, Engineering sees tool registry,
Security sees audit logs.

For SOC 2 compliance, we have pre-filled security questionnaires ready.
Most of our customers go from 6-month audit prep to 4-week prep.

[Pause. Ask: "When's your next compliance audit?"]
```

**CLOSE (23-30 min) - THE DECISION**
```
Let me recap what I showed you:

1. Cost visibility - $250K spend visible in 30 seconds (saves 2+ weeks)
2. Cost optimization - $48K/month savings per team ($576K/year total)
3. MCP governance - Duplicate detection, consolidation (saves $150K/year)
4. Compliance readiness - Audit logs, access control (4-week vs 6-month audit)

That's roughly $726K/year in value we've identified.

The investment is Pro tier at $2,000/month = $24K/year.

30x ROI.

Now, there are a few ways we can move forward:

Option 1: 14-day free trial - you can test with your team
Option 2: 30-minute security review call - get your CISO comfortable
Option 3: Both - start trial while security reviews

Which would make most sense for you?

[Wait for answer. Don't fill silence. Let them decide.]
