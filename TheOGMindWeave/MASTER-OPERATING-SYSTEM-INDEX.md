## HOW TO CUSTOMIZE (IMPORTANT!)

This system is a **framework, not a straight jacket**.

### DO Customize:
- [ ] Sales scripts (use your language, not verbatim)
- [ ] Feature prioritization (match your product)
- [ ] Financial projections (adjust based on your CAC/LTV)
- [ ] Team cadences (adjust meeting times)
- [ ] Risk dashboard (track risks specific to you)

### DON'T Customize:
- [ ] Operating rhythm structure (daily/weekly/monthly cadence)
- [ ] Customer obsession principle (this is core)
- [ ] Metrics tracking (measure what matters)
- [ ] Decision-making framework (7-question method works)
- [ ] Weekly retrospective (continuous learning)

**The structure should stay the same. The details adapt to you.**

---

## IF YOU'RE NOT SURE WHERE TO START

**Follow this path:**
