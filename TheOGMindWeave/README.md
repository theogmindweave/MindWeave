## What is This?

This is the complete documentation for building MindWeave - an enterprise AI governance platform - from zero to one. Everything is in Markdown. No code until the research, planning, and strategy are complete.

## The APIR Method

We follow **APIR** for everything:
- **A**dapt - Learn from research, feedback, market
- **P**rune - Remove what doesn't work, focus on essentials
- **I**mprove - Iterate based on learnings
- **R**epeat - Continuous evolution
